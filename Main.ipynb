On February 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the infectious disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] . On March 12, 2020 , the COVID-19 viral disease has swept into at least 117 countries and killed more than 4000 people, and WHO officially announced a pandemic of COVID-19 viral disease [3] . As of March 22, 2020 , many studies reported the clinical and immunological characteristics of the general population with COVID-19, but the studies on pregnant women with COVID-19 and their fetuses were relatively rare [4, 5] . More investigations are needed to explore the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women and their fetuses and neonates.On one side, due to the changes of pregnancy hormones and metabolic disturbance, some pregnant women during the third trimester experience several metabolic complications. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common metabolic complication during pregnancy, which presents with insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction [6] . Besides that, the changes of pregnancy hormones can prevent the cells from using up the glucose, and the body starts using up the fat reserves to attain the required energy, which leads to the production of ketones and pregnancy complications like ketonuria [7] . In the first and early second trimesters, healthy pregnancy remains immune quiescence and inhibition to allow the immunologically distinct fetoplacental unit to develop and grow, and in the third trimester, immune quiescence and inhibition are reversed in association with immune activation and functional immune responses [8, 9] . So how did the metabolic characteristics and the immune responses during the third trimester affect the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women?On the other side, some viruses, including rubella virus, EB virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), can spread through intrauterine transmission and pose high risks of health problems in fetuses and neonates [10] [11] [12] . When the virus crosses the placenta to the fetus, we can detect the present of viruses in the amniotic fluid, cord blood, and placenta. Additionally, antivirus IgM antibody might present in the serum of fetus while the fetus infects the virus in the uterus [13] . Previous studies described that no evidence of intrauterine transmission was observed in SARS or MERS, but abortion and preterm birth have been reported in cases of infection with SARS and MERS during pregnancy [14, 15] . So far, whether SARS-CoV-2 can spread through intrauterine transmission and how COVID-19 infection affect the fetuses during pregnancy remain largely unknown.Sixteen pregnant women with COVID-19, 35 to 39 weeks of gestation, were admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and delivered 16 neonates by cesarean section. In this study, we investigated 16 pregnant patients and their neonates to explore the risks of metabolic complications and outcomes of COVID-19 pregnant women. In the meanwhile, we examined whether SARS-CoV-2 can spread to fetuses through intrauterine transmission, and explored whether COVID-19 infection in pregnant women posed health problems of fetuses and neonates.In this study, the data from 16 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected and analyzed, including clinical characteristics, CT scan images, blood and urine tests, and other primary data. And all these tests were applied to their 16 neonates delivered by cesarean section. All the data recorded from COVID-19 pregnant women and their neonates have been reviewed by a group of professional doctors. The Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University had approved the study design.Diagnosis of all the cases was based on the WHO interim guidance. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were harvested from pregnant women with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and were detected for ORF1ab and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. In order to eliminate the infection of other respiratory tract pathogens, nasopharyngeal swab samples were tested for the genes of respiratory tract pathogens, including influenza A virus types of H1N1 and H3N2, influenza A virus (2009), influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, common coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and chlamydia pneumoniae.Assessing the potential metabolic complications of pregnant women with COVID-19Blood samples and urine samples were collected from 16 pregnant women with COVID-19. Blood tests were performed for coagulation profile (FDP, D-dimer, and FIB, etc.) and serum biochemical analysis (AST, ALP, CK, LDH, UA, and procalcitonin, etc). The urine samples were tested for bilirubin, glucose, and ketone body, etc. These metabolic indicators were assessed for metabolic complications in pregnant women with COVID-19.Assessing the immunological characteristics in COVID-19 pregnant women during the acute stage and recovery stage During the acute stage and recovery stage of COVID-19, blood samples from 16 pregnant women were collected and examined complete blood cell (CBC) and different lymphocyte subsets, as well as humoral immune function (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, C3, and C4). C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-10 and procalcitonin (PCT) were measured for the assessment of inflammatory responses. The titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in pregnant women with COVID-19 were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China). The titers of IgM and IgG in healthy person are < 10 AU/mL.For assessing the potential impact on fetuses of pregnant women with COVID-19, the neonatal blood samples were collected at birth, and were examined for complete blood cell (CBC) and coagulation profile, as well as serum biochemical analysis. Nasopharyngeal swab samples of neonates were harvested at the time of giving birth, and were detected the N gene and ORF1ab genes of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. For the suspected intrauterine infection of SARS-CoV-2, the titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay, and CT scan images were taken for further assessment.Continuous variables were described as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), and categorical variables were described as percentages. These variables were compared using the unpaired t test with Welch's correction. For comparative analyses, a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, while < 0.01 was considered highly statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 and SPSS 25.0.The clinical characteristics of 16 pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester Pregnant women suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to hospitals after January 30, 2020. Sixteen pregnant women, gestation ages of 35-39 weeks, were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCT results, in conjunction with CT scan images. The symptoms of these pregnant women included fever, cough, diarrhea, and minor shortness of breath (Table 1 ). In 13 out of 16 (81.2%) pregnant patients, the images of chest CT scan presented multiple patchy, ground glass opacity in the left and/or right lungs, which illustrated the typical image features of COVID-19. Three out of 16 (18.8%) showed untypical images, including multiple patchy consolidations with high density shadows in the lobes of lungs. Four out of 16 (25%) patients had small amount of pleural effusion and partial pleural thickening (Fig. 1 ).In order to explore the metabolic changes in pregnant women during the period of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed various metabolic indicators of blood and urine samples. In 16 pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester, 3 patients had gestational diabetes milletus. The blood uric acid of patients was 334 μmol/L (IQR, 269-452), which are much higher than those of healthy pregnant women (288 μmol/L (IQR, 232-308)). In the meanwhile, the osmotic pressure was lower than that of healthy pregnant women. In urine samples, 11 out of 16 (69%) pregnant women with COVID-19 had ++ or +++ of ketone body, which indicated the disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism (Table 1 ). These pregnant patients may have a potentially high risk of metabolic complication, ketonuria. The levels of D-dimer and FDP in pregnant women with COVID-19 were 3.32 mg/L (IQR, 2.18-4.21) and 9.6 mg/L (IQR, 5.9-12.4), which were much higher than those of healthy pregnant women, 1.70 mg/L (IQR, 1.07-2.60) and 4.9 mg/L (IQR, 3.3-7.2), respectively (Table 1) . These results demonstrated that pregnant women with COVID-19 experienced the state of hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis.In these pregnant women with COVID-19, lymphocytes were 1.1 × 10 9 /L (IQR, 0.9-1.5) during the acute stage. The analysis of lymphocytes subsets reflected that these patients had CD4 + T cells (428/μL (IQR, 288-487)) and CD8 + T cells (430/μL (IQR, 405-456)), NK cells (133/μL (IQR, 56-185)), and B cells (112/μL (IQR, 85-141)), which remained in the normal range. Besides that, the examinations of IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, C3, and C4 showed that these pregnant patients held normal humoral immune responses (Table 2 ). Further investigation found that these pregnant patients had a high level of monocytes during the acute stage and recovery stage of COVID-19, which might have the benefit to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. During the period of recovery, these pregnant patients had much more lymphocytes (1.6 × 10 9 /L (IQR, 1.2-1.9)) than those in the early stage of COVID-19. These patients also had high titers of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 102.9 AU/mL (IQR, 63.6-117.6) of IgM and 125.1 AU/mL (IQR, 88.2-151.7) of IgG, respectively. On day 7 after the onset of COVID-19, one pregnant woman already had 35.1 AU/mL of SARS-CoV IgM ( Table 2 ). The lymphocyte count and the titer of IgG antibodies could be considered as the immunological indicators to monitor the recovery of COVID-19. During the period of recovery, images of chest CT scan reflected that obvious improvement of lung lesions, and absorption of pleural effusion (Fig. 1) .Sixteen neonates were delivered by cesarean section at the gestational age of 37-39 weeks. Sixteen neonates had 1-min Apgar scores of 7 to 9 and 5-min Apgar scores of 8 to 10. The median birth weight of these neonates was 3.13 kg (IQR, 2.85-3.54). To elucidate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection of pregnant women affected fetuses, we collected the blood samples of neonates at birth from the mothers with COVID-19. The comparative analysis indicated that the leukocytes of these neonates were 15.7 × 10 9 /L (IQR, 13.7-17.2), exceptionally higher than those of neonates from healthy pregnant women (12.3 × 10 9 /L (IQR, 9.0-13.2)) (p < 0.01). Similar to the high level of neutrophils (11.1 × 10 9 /L (IQR, 9.2-13.2)), the high ratio of neutrophil and lymphocytes, 4.3 (IQR, 3.2-5.6), presented in these neonates. In the meanwhile, PCT was high than 4.95 in 4 out of 16 (25%) neonates ( Table 3 ). The findings indicated that the inflammatory responses and pathological changes might present in placenta before neonates born from mother with COVID-19.Further analyses of metabolic parameters showed that these 16 neonates from mother with COVID-19 had low level of PO2 (74 mmHg (IQR, 50-80)) and SO2 (93% (IQR, 82-95)). Extremely high levels of CK 401 U/L (IQR, 382-647) and LDH 445 U/L (IQR, 417-559), presented the potential cardiac dysregulation. These 16 neonates had a high level of GGT Table 3) .In this study, we thoroughly assessed the potential intrauterine transmission among these 16 neonates. One pregnant woman with COVID-19 delivered a neonate by cesarean section and the neonate had fever 24 h after birth. This neonate tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 genes in the nasopharyngeal swab, and CT scan images also reflected the features of virus infection (Fig.1) , which indicated that this neonate might have intrauterine infection with SARS-CoV-2.Another pregnant woman, 35 weeks of gestation, had typical CT scan images of virus infection and was admitted to the hospital on day 7 after the onset of COVID-19. After the treatment with Arbidol and Oseltamivir for 3 weeks, the N gene and ORF1ab genes of SARS-CoV-2 still showed strongly positive (+++) in the nasopharyngeal swab, and high titers of IgM (108 AU/mL) and IgG (98 AU/mL) presented in the blood sample of this pregnant patient. At 38 weeks of gestation, a neonate was delivered from this pregnant woman with COVID-19 by cesarean section. On day 1 after birth, this neonate had the titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgM (46 AU/mL), and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (140 AU/mL). And on day 15 after birth, this neonate had the titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgM (12 AU/mL), and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (70 AU/mL).With significant changes in endocrine hormones and receptors, as well as the level of progesterone, pregnant women in the third trimester are prone to experience some complications, such as GDM, ketonuria, heart disease, and coagulation disorders [6, 7] . This study found that 11 out of 16 (68.8%) pregnant women with COVID-19 had ++ or +++ of ketone body in urine. The blood glucose levels were monitored for these patients, and the patients were administrated with iv injection of glucose while they had low of blood glucose and urine ketone body ++ or +++. The blood uric acid of patients was 334 μmol/L (IQR, 269-452), which were much higher than those of healthy pregnant women (288 μmol/L (IQR, 232-308)). In the meanwhile, the osmotic pressure was lower than that of healthy pregnant women. These results showed that in the third trimester, the COVID-19 infection aggravated the metabolic disturbance. We need to pay attention on the high risk of metabolic complication, ketonuria in patients with COVID-19 during late pregnancy. Late pregnancy experiences the changes of coagulation profile, including the increase of clotting factors, the decrease of natural anticoagulants and the reduced activity of the fibrinolytic enzyme. These changes are associated with the state of hypercoagulability, and pregnant women are prone to have the potential risk of thrombosis and DIC [16, 17] . The levels of Ddimer and FDP in pregnant women with COVID-19 were 3.32 mg/L (IQR, 2.18-4.21) and 9.6 mg/L (IQR, 5.9-12.4), which were much higher than those of healthy pregnant women. COVID-19 infection increased the high risk of hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis, even potential DIC during late pregnancy. The COVID-19 patients with high risk of hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis were administrated with low-molecular-weight heparin during the perinatal period.B cells and NK cells, as well as CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells reduced slightly, and these pregnant patients held healthy humoral immune, which were similar to the immunological characteristics of non-pregnant persons with mild COVID-19 infection [18, 19] . Further investigation found that these pregnant women had a high level of monocytes during the acute stage and recovery stage, which might have the benefit to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. During the recovery period, these pregnant patients had much more lymphocytes (1.6 × 10 9 /L (IQR, 1.2-1.9)) than those of acute stage of COVID-19, and also had high titers of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 102.9 AU/mL (IQR, 63.6-117.6) of IgM and 125.1 AU/mL (IQR, 88.2-151.7) of IgG, respectively. The functional immune responses presented in the third trimester could contribute to the recovery of COVID-19 pregnant women.Previous studies suggest that the virus infections during the pregnancy are associated with the high rate of complications in fetuses, such as the spontaneous abortion, the premature birth, and the intrauterine growth restriction [20, 21] . To further elucidate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection of pregnant women affected fetuses, we collected the blood samples of neonates at birth from mothers with COVID-19. The comparative analysis indicated that these neonates had exceptionally high level of leukocytes and neutrophils (15.7 × 10 9 /L (IQR, 13.7-17.2)) and (11.1 × 10 9 /L (IQR, 9.2-13.2)), respectively. The ratio of neutrophil and lymphocytes was 4.3 (IQR, 3.2-5.6) in these neonates and PCT of 25% neonates was higher than 4.64 mg/L. These findings suggest that inflammatory responses might occur in placenta before neonate born from mother with COVID-19. Previous study reported that the placentas had pathological changes and abnormal weight when the mothers infected SARS-CoV during late pregnancy [22] .Further analysis indicated that these 16 neonates had low level of PO2 (74 mmHg (IQR, 50-80)) and SO2 (93% (IQR, 82-95)), and high levels of CK 401 U/L (IQR, 382-647) and LDH 445 U/L (IQR, 417-559), as well as the changes of coagulation profile. These results of the blood samples collected on sooner after of neonate birth, indicated that organ dysregulations might happen in the fetuses and neonates during pregnancy with COVID-19.One of the most critical questions is whether the virus can transmit to fetuses while the pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 [14, 15] . In our study, a pregnant woman with COVID-19 delivered a neonate. 24 h after birth, this neonate had fever. The neonate had positive result of SARS-CoV-2 genes, and CT scan images also showed the features of virus infection. Yu et al. reported that the neonate was confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 36 h after birth [23] . A study tested positive of E, RdRP, and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 in a placenta of pregnant women with COVID-19 [24] . These findings suggest that fetuses might have potential intrauterine infection while mother infected with SARS-CoV-2. Another pregnant woman with 35 weeks of gestation was admitted to the hospital on day 7 after the onset of COVID-19, and strongly positive for SARS-CoV-2 (+++) for 4 weeks. A neonate [25] . SARS-CoV-2 IgM in the neonates might have been produced by the fetuses if the high titer of virus crossed the placenta to fetuses. COVID-19 infection induced inflammatory responses and might cause the pathological changes of placentas, and the increased SARS-CoV-2 IgM in fetus might be transferred from mother through placenta under pathological condition. In our study, chest CT scan images of 16 pregnant patients with COVID-19 showed multiple patchy, ground glass opacity, or multiple patchy shadows with increased density in the lungs. Four of 16 (25%) pregnant patients with COVID-19 had small amount of pleural effusion and partial pleural thickening on both sides. Chest CT represents the good standard to assess COVID-19 pneumonia. Buonsenso et al. reported the results using lung ultrasound for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women and children. These studies showed that lung ultrasound examination can be a valid alternative to CT scan and X-ray, particularly for reducing unnecessary radiation in pregnant women and children [26, 27] .In this study, we presented the metabolic and immunological changes of 16 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their neonates. During the third trimester and peripartum, COVID-19 infection raised the high risk of metabolic complication, including ketonuria, hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis in pregnant women. In order to avoid severe complications during the third trimester and peripartum, it is very important for patients with COVID-19 to monitor the levels of blood glucose and urine ketone body, and to administrate with injection of glucose and heparin, etc. The functional immune responses in the third trimester contributed to the recovery of COVID-19 in pregnant patients. On the other side, fetuses and neonates might suffer from the inflammatory responses and metabolic dysregulation while their mother infected with SARS-CoV-2 during late pregnancy. Our investigation indicated that there might be a potential intrauterine infection of fetuses while pregnant women had high titer of SARS-CoV-2, but it is necessary to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the blood cord, placenta, and amniotic fluid to further confirm the intrauterine infection of fetuses.\n",
            "\t23.615\t4e3e70755c327f0207dc992bc6ec837fc21e5a87\tsurge across the globe, the approval of vaccines is welcome news. These vaccines are likely our most powerful intervention to stem the tide of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. However, it will take time, political will, and widespread public support to achieve vaccination rates high enough to control the pandemic. As the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issues emergency use authorizations for vaccines, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is issuing recommendations about who should receive the vaccine and their priority for receipt (1) . It is important to recognize where pregnant persons fit into this national framework. Health care workers, of whom as many as 300 000 may be pregnant, are in the highest-priority tier for vaccination and are currently being vaccinated. The next wave of vaccinations will be offered to persons with medical conditions, many of whom may also be pregnant.Following the emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine and the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists offer the following recommendations. Pregnant persons should be offered the vaccine and should be encouraged to talk with their obstetric provider about their vaccination plan, although this is not a requirement for vaccination. Lactating persons should be encouraged to receive the vaccine. Persons planning to become pregnant should be encouraged to complete their vaccination series before conception to ensure that they are protected before pregnancy.Here, we discuss the rationale supporting these recommendations. To appreciate why pregnant women are included in these early vaccination efforts, it is important to understand the interplay between pregnancy and COVID-19. Recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant persons is associated with increased risk for intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and death (2) . Although the relative risks in pregnancy are increased, the absolute risks for severe disease are low, with about 1% of pregnant women in the United States requiring admission to an intensive care unit and 1.5 deaths per 1000 pregnant women with COVID-19 (2). Pregnant women with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, may have excess risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes (3). Further, the same racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes seen in the general population are observed in the pregnant population (4). Some, but not all, studies have observed an association between COVID-19 and risk for preterm births and cesarean deliveries (5) . Taken together, the evidence suggests that pregnant women with COVID-19 have higher risk than similar nonpregnant persons for poor health outcomes and that risks may also be higher for their babies. Thus, it is critical that pregnant persons have the opportunity to be vaccinated if they would otherwise meet the criteria for vaccination. However, because pregnant women were excluded from COVID-19 vaccination trials, we have limited information about effectiveness and safety in this group.That said, we do have some data to help inform discussion with pregnant persons. First, these vaccines contain mRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle that is delivered into host cells. The body's own host cells generate coronavirus spike proteins that stimulate antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This activity occurs robustly in regional lymph nodes (6) . There is no biological reason to suspect that this process is different during pregnancy, so we expect similar efficacy in pregnant and nonpregnant persons. Second, these vaccines contain no live virus or adjuvants that could affect the developing fetus. Further, available data about developmental and reproductive toxicity generated from rats administered the Moderna mRNA vaccine show no safety signals concerning female reproduction, fetal or embryonal development, or postnatal development (7) . Finally, although COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with fever usually lasting less than 2 days, acetaminophen is acceptable treatment of fever in pregnancy, and vaccine-associated fever is no exception. Still, concerns will linger until human pregnancy data are available. Pregnancy-specific trials will provide data to address not only safety concerns, such as vaccine-associated miscarriage or fetal anomalies, but also vaccine efficacy for mother and possibly newborn through passively transferred antibodies. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that clinicians discuss with pregnant persons COVID-19 pregnancy risks, personal factors aside from pregnancy that may increase SARS-CoV-2 infection risk or disease severity, and benefits of and unknowns about vaccination. Information for providers to use when counseling, as well as patient information, has been developed (8) .The use of vaccines to protect pregnant persons and their newborns from infectious diseases is an integral part of routine obstetric practice. Seasonal influenza vaccine protects mothers from severe illness while protecting neonates in the first several months of life. The tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine is given in each pregnancy between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation to protect mother and baby from pertussis. These vaccines provide the best protection against known devastating effects of these viruses and have excellent safety profiles established using animal data and epidemiologic studies in pregnant women (9, 10) . In the case of COVID-19, time is of the essence. Preventing ongoing severe illness due to COVID-19 for reproductive-aged women, including those who are pregnant or postpartum, necessitates This article was published at Annals.org on 26 January 2021.Annals of Internal Medicine © 2021 American College of Physicians 1a prompt response given our current knowledge about the efficacy and safety of these vaccines.Of note, few if any vaccines are contraindicated in breastfeeding women; even the live vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella is routinely recommended in nonimmune women after delivery regardless of lactation status. Clinicians should encourage women who are breastfeeding to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Given the mechanism of action of mRNA vaccines, there is no reason for concern that vaccination would introduce virus into breastmilk.Women who meet criteria for vaccination and are planning to become pregnant should be encouraged to complete the 2-dose vaccine before pregnancy. Doing so will afford them maximal protection once they become pregnant. Although the vaccine trials required pregnancy tests before study participation, pregnancy tests should not be required before COVID-19 vaccination. Data on the outcomes of the small number of women who became pregnant in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna trials are not yet available because most of these pregnancies are ongoing.In summary, safe and effective vaccines are now available to protect people from COVID-19 and help end this devastating pandemic. On the basis of what we know about the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, as well as broader principles of how vaccines work and the safety of other vaccines during pregnancy and breastfeeding, it seems that pregnant and lactating women can be safely included in vaccination efforts. Clinicians should be prepared to discuss the issues outlined here with their pregnant and lactating patients, as well as with those who may be considering pregnancy.

[1] [2] [3] The first data emerged from the experience of health care providers in Wuhan, China, and knowledge of COVID-19 continues to increase as the pandemic spreads. 4 It remains unclear if use of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation and decreasing neonatal morbidity and mortality outweighs the maternal risk of corticosteroid exposure in women with COVID-19 infection.When a woman is at high risk of preterm birth, corticosteroids are administered to decrease risk of neonatal morbidity associated with prematurity. According to a 2017 Cochrane review, antenatal corticosteroid administration is associated with reduced neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), among other improved clinical outcomes. 5 Although there were limited number of studies included in the analysis on maternal morbidity and mortality, it was concluded that there was no increased risk of maternal harm from antenatal corticosteroid exposure.During the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreaks, steroids were commonly used to manage hospitalized patients. 6 However, studies following the outbreaks demonstrated corticosteroid therapy was associated with worse outcomes, including increased mortality and delayed clearance of viral RNA. 7-10 Given the evidence available from previous outbreaks, corticosteroid therapy is currently not routinely recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 infection.This, however, presents a clinical dilemma for obstetrics patients, for whom the health of both the woman and infant are important in medical decision making. While women at high risk of preterm birth are typically managed with antenatal corticosteroids for infant benefit, clinicians must weigh the potential harms associated with corticosteroid use in a patient with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we sought to determine the gestational ages for which administration of antenatal corticosteroids to women at high risk of preterm birth with COVID-19 infection results in higher combined maternal and infant outcomes than expectant management.We created a decision-analytic model using TreeAge (2020 version, TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown, MA,) software to assess the clinical outcomes and total maternal and infant quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the administration of antenatal corticosteroids for women at high risk of preterm birth with COVID-19 infection. We used a theoretical cohort of 10,000 women in the United States who were infected with COVID-19 and also at high risk of preterm birth at each gestational age between 24 0/7 and 33 6/7 weeks. This theoretical cohort was used as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve with estimates of potential impact on women and pregnancy changing daily, so a more precise theoretical cohort was not calculated. As this was a theoretical model with inputs derived from the published literature, and no patients were required for the study, the study was deemed to be exempt from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.The model begins by separating the two strategies: administration of antenatal corticosteroids versus expectant management with no administration of corticosteroids (►Fig. 1). It was assumed that all women delivered during the gestational age in which they were given steroids. Antenatal corticosteroid treatment consists of two injections of betamethasone given 24 hours apart to improve fetal lung maturity in preterm deliveries if clinical indications were consistent with imminent delivery within 7 days. Then, women were stratified based on whether they needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission or died. Infant outcomes of interest were death, RDS, IVH, and neurodevelopmental delay.Our probabilities and utilities were derived from literature and these model inputs are shown in ►Table 1. The probabilities for maternal ICU admission and death from COVID-19 infection were estimated from the reported cases in the United States of individuals aged 20 to 44 years up to March 16, 2020 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 response team. 11 The effects of steroids on probability of admission to ICU and mortality was estimated by a hazard ratio of 1.49 that was reported in a systematic review of steroids in the setting of hospitalized patients with influenza. 12 In hospitalized patients, we assumed a probability of 0.22 for ICU admission with steroid administration, and 0.15 for ICU admission without steroids. We assumed that if a woman with COVID-19 was to die, she would have been previously admitted to the ICU. We utilized a probability of maternal death of 0.05 for women treated with steroids or not, as her probability of being admitted to the ICU was affected by steroid use. However, for our model of women already in the ICU, we assumed her probability of death with steroid administration was 0.075 and 0.05 without steroids. 11 For infant outcomes, the probabilities of RDS, IVH and death by gestational age from 24 to 33 weeks were determined from a large prospective cohort study that compared antenatal corticosteroid administration to no treatment (►Supplementary Table S1 , available in the online version). 5, 13 The probability of neurodevelopmental delay was estimated from a prospective cohort study, which assessed cognitive disability and hearing and visual impairment of children born before 33 weeks of gestation at 5 years of age (►Supplementary Table S2 , available in the online version). 14 Neurodevelopmental sequelae and infant death differences with presence or absence of IVH were calculated based on an odds ratio of 6.02 and 5.64, respectively. 15 Utilities were included from both the maternal and infant perspective and discounted at an annual rate of 3%. 16 Utilities are used to estimate the quality of life and range from 0 to 1, with 0 being death and 1 meaning perfect health. Utilities are then applied to discounted life-years to generate discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A woman's life expectancy following a first pregnancy was estimated to be 56.2 years based on average age of first birth and current estimated life expectancy. 17, 18 For healthy children and neurodevelopmentally delayed children, life expectancies were estimated to be 78.8 years and 62 years, respectively. [19] [20] [21] For any woman who required ICU admission, a utility of 0.66 was used and applied for 1 year, based on quality of life estimates for 1 year after initial ICU admission. 22 Utilities regarding infant outcomes from the maternal perspective were derived from data from Carroll and Downs which asked guardians to provide utilities for chosen health states that included having a child in perfect health, a child who died, and a child with neurodevelopmental delay. 23 We estimated the maternal utility for having a child with neurodevelopmental delay by using the value for moderate cerebral palsy, 0.76. We estimated a maternal utility of 0.92 for having an infant who did not survive. 24 For infant utilities, we used survey data, which assessed selfperceived quality of life of extremely low birth weight neonates who were followed into adulthood. The infant utility of moderate neurodevelopmental delay was estimated to be 0.69. In addition, as all neonates born in this model were preterm, we applied a utility of 0.95 for the average length of stay for preterm neonate, which we calculated to be 28.3 days. 23, 25, 26 Sensitivity analyses were performed on all model inputs to determine the robustness of the results. We performed a tornado analysis, which is a mechanism of running one-way sensitivity analyses on all model inputs simultaneously to determine which inputs have the most effect on the model. Model inputs identified then were subjected to focused oneway sensitivity analyses to determine thresholds.We also performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis via Monte Carlo simulation, which enabled us to incorporate variation into all model inputs simultaneously and determine the proportion of the time a strategy is still effective with 1,000 samples. Beta distributions were used for probabilities and utilities, which approximate the normal distribution and cannot fall outside of the range 0 to 1. Triangular distributions were used for life expectancies. The results of the simulation are presented in a bar graph, showing the confidence of each strategy.In our theoretical cohort of 10,000 women at high risk of preterm delivery between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation with COVID-19 infection, corticosteroid administration resulted in 2,200 women admitted to the ICU and 110 maternal deaths at each gestational age (►Table 2). In contrast, no antenatal corticosteroids resulted in 1,500 ICU admissions and 75 maternal deaths at each gestational age. Of the women already admitted into the ICU, there were 500 deaths without steroid administration and 745 deaths with steroids (►Table 3). Although administration of corticosteroids resulted in worse maternal morbidity and mortality for women, it was associated with better outcomes for infants, including fewer cases of RDS, IVH, and death. For example, at 28 weeks of gestation, corticosteroid administration resulted in 550 fewer cases of RDS, 230 fewer cases of IVH and 419 fewer deaths. Total QALYs are shown in ►Table 4. We found that management with antenatal corticosteroids in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection resulted in higher QALYs from a combined maternal and infant perspective from 24 0/7 to 31 6/7 weeks of gestation (►Table 4; ►Supplementary Tables S3-S10 [available in the online version]). Despite the worse maternal outcomes with corticosteroid use at 28 weeks of gestation and greater, the infant benefits of steroids below 32 weeks of gestation outweighed the potential maternal harm. At 32 and 33 weeks of gestation, management without antenatal corticosteroid administration resulted in higher QALYs and thus was the optimal strategy (►Supplementary Tables S11 and S12, available in the online version).Among women in the ICU due to COVID-19 infection, there was higher risk of maternal death with corticosteroid administration. Due to this, antenatal steroid administration was the optimal strategy through 29 weeks of gestation, resulting in higher QALYs than expectant management. At 30 weeks of gestation, administration of antenatal corticosteroids was no longer the optimal strategy. Univariate sensitivity were performed across a wide range for all model inputs for the latest gestational ages at which corticosteroids resulted in higher combined maternal and infant outcomes. For hospitalized women with COVID-19 at 31 weeks of gestation, the probabilities of ICU admission, maternal death, and neurodevelopmental delay with corticosteroid exposure were most important to our model (►Fig. 2). Antenatal corticosteroids for hospitalized women at high risk of preterm delivery became the less effective management strategy when the probability of maternal ICU admission increased to 31.6% and the probability of death following an ICU admission increased to 7.7%. When the probability of neurodevelopmental delay with steroid exposure increased to greater than 9.6%, the infant benefits from corticosteroid exposure no longer outweighed the risks to hospitalized women at 31 weeks of gestation. For women admitted to the ICU at 29 weeks of gestation with COVID-19, the probability of maternal death and neurodevelopmental delay were also important to our model. When the probability of maternal death in the ICU was greater than 7.85% and the probability of neurodevelopmental delay increased above 12.8%, not using antenatal corticosteroids was the optimal management strategy for women in the ICU at 29 weeks of gestation. During our multivariable analysis via Monte Carlo simulation, we found that administering corticosteroids was optimal 100% of the time at 24, 25, and 26 weeks of gestation for women who are hospitalized (►Table 5). For the weeks in which total QALYs were greater without antenatal corticosteroid administration, which were 32 weeks of gestation for hospitalized women and 30 weeks of gestation for women admitted to the ICU, corticosteroid administration was only optimal 43.2 and 25.9% of the time, respectively. As gestational age increased, the frequency of the time in which corticosteroid administration was effective decreased. In hospitalized patients and women admitted to the ICU at 33 weeks of gestation, corticosteroids were an effective management strategy 0 and 3.4% of the time, respectively.In this study, we found that antenatal corticosteroid administration for women at risk of preterm delivery with COVID-19 infection was an effective management strategy from a combined maternal-infant perspective below 32 weeks of gestation for hospitalized patients and below 30 weeks of gestation for women admitted to the ICU when compared with not administering steroids. In our theoretical cohort, with increasing gestational age at which imminent delivery may occur, steroid administration becomes less effective when both maternal and infant outcomes are considered.In March, 2020, it was projected that 20 to 60% of the U.S. population could become infected with COVID-19. 27 Therefore, with an estimated 3.9 million births in the United States per year, of which 2.76% are early preterm (less than 34 weeks of gestation), the number of pregnant women with preterm births infected with COVID-19 could be between 60,000 to 190,000. 18, 26 With the high number of women and clinicians encountering this issue, determining the optimal management in this setting is important. Our model findings were consistent with published data for previous worldwide viral outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and influenza. 7, 12, 28 It has been widely demonstrated in the literature that corticosteroid administration in adults with these infections is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, although the exact mechanism is unknown. We found that the probabilities of maternal admission to the ICU and mortality following corticosteroid administration were impactful to our findings during sensitivity analysis. However, it is important to note that the evidence for the effects of corticosteroids in MERS, SARS, and influenza were in the setting of high-dose hydrocortisone corticosteroid treatment, and many of these patients had a more severe disease course. Betamethasone is typically used for antenatal steroid administration. Therefore, it is important that future studies investigate the effects of antenatal corticosteroid on maternal morbidity and mortality during viral outbreaks like COVID-19.Our model findings were also consistent with published data for the consequences of preterm delivery. We found that the frequency of IVH, neurodevelopmental delay, and infant death were highest at 24 weeks of gestation and decreased as gestational age increased. Similarly, the frequency of each of these adverse outcomes were lower with maternal antenatal corticosteroid administration. Typically, this management strategy would not be questioned, as there are minimal known negative consequences of corticosteroid administration to pregnant women. However, in this setting of COVID-19 infection, when the effects of adverse infant and maternal outcomes are balanced, there is a point at which infant benefit is outweighed, such as is seen with expectant management of severe preeclampsia. Additionally, we found that this gestational age tipping point differed for women who were hospitalized versus already in the ICU.To date, there are no retrospective cohort studies evaluating the effects of antenatal corticosteroids in women with COVID-19 infection and their infants. Mcintosh recently published clinical guidance for corticosteroid use in pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and her recommendations that steroids should not be used over 32 weeks of gestation, and that decisions should be based on multidisciplinary shared decision making are consistent with our results. While the paper does include data on worsening patient outcomes in COVID-19 with steroid exposure, there are multiple confounders to consider, making the data potentially unreliable. 29 This is the first decision analysis of its type to investigate the maternal and infant consequences of corticosteroid use during a viral pandemic. The use of decision analysis is an important tool enabling the estimation of clinical implications of corticosteroid administration for both women and infants on a population level, which is a strength of this study as decisions in obstetrics typically are based on a balance of infant and maternal impact.Decision-analytic models are not without limitations. Models are inherently subject to uncertainty, as model inputs rely on previously published evidence. Despite the quick spread of infection, there is still little evidence on its implications for pregnant women and their infants. 30 With the current dynamic environment and progression of infection throughout the world, it is important to note that much of this study on the impact of steroids on ICU admission and maternal mortality relied on data from previous influenza studies. Corticosteroid therapy was often used as adjunct therapy for management of SARS, MERS, and influenza to little benefit for patients, but the data for COVID-19 is currently limited. It is also important to acknowledge that corticosteroids used for respiratory syndromes are different than the betamethasone given for fetal lung maturity. Although betamethasone and hydrocortisone are both corticosteroids, they differ in potency, duration of action, and ability to cross the placenta. 31 Betamethasone is given in two doses of 12-mg intramuscularly 24 hours apart. This would be equivalent to 320 mg of hydrocortisone, which is similar to the dosing given in MERS as reported by Arabi et al of 300 mg daily for a median of 7 days. 5, 7 We also assumed that any woman who died from COVID-19 while pregnant would be treated in the ICU, which was not assumed in the paper by Arabi et al, and it is not necessarily the case in hospitals in the United States that are overwhelmed with the number of COVID-19 cases. Further, many previous studies investigating SARS, MERS, and influenza contained few female participants.However, we are reassured by our univariate and multivariate analyses that despite a wide range of values in our study for maternal morbidity and mortality following steroids administration, the outcomes do not greatly differ. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, further evidence on the impact of antenatal corticosteroids on maternal and infant outcomes may affect which gestational ages that corticosteroid administration should be recommended.Another limitation was that our cohort of interest was symptomatic hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and are at risk of delivery within the next 7 days. Several patients who are hospitalized for clinical management of pregnancy complications, such as preterm prelabor rupture of membrane and preeclampsia, will not deliver within the week. 32 Our model does not factor in the population at low risk for imminent preterm delivery and the latency until delivery following presentation. As COVID-19 lasts approximately 2 weeks in a majority of patients, if a woman continues to be pregnant for 2 weeks or greater following initial presentation, she potentially no longer has the associated risks of steroid exposure in the setting of an infection. Further, there are many more asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients than symptomatic, thus this model is only applicable to symptomatic patients at high risk for preterm delivery. 33 COVID-19 test results should not be a prerequisite for administration of antenatal steroids to an asymptomatic patient at risk for pre-term delivery.In conclusion, our findings suggest that antenatal corticosteroid administration for women at high risk of preterm delivery with a COVID-19 infection have improved combined maternal and infant outcomes below 32 weeks of gestation for hospitalized patients and below 30 weeks of gestation for patients admitted to the ICU. As decisions regarding care of women and infants in the preterm period are complex, the risks, benefits, and alternatives should be considered during conversations with patients. This decision analysis was conducted because of the paucity of data informing the use of antenatal corticosteroids for preterm delivery in COVID-19positive patients. Thus, care of women with respiratory compromise from COVID-19 should be individualized, and such patients should receive multidisciplinary team care, with MFM and critical care specialists. The results of the study can guide management with the clinical dilemma of weighing maternal risks to infant benefits in the preterm period of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection.None.\n",

Older adults, persons with certain coexisting conditions, and front-line workers are at highest risk for COVID-19 and its complications, and, as such, the Centers for Disease Control recommended prioritizing these populations for vaccination. Recent data have shown that other populations, including pregnant women, may also be at increased risk [2, 3] ; however, pregnant women were excluded from initial clinical trials [4, 5] until sufficient safety data in nonpregnant adults had been demonstrated.Because of changes in adaptive immunity and physiology associated with pregnancy, there is a theoretical basis to suggest that pregnant women may be at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] [9] .While not yet conclusive, studies have shown that pregnancy is associated with a greater risk of severe disease among women presenting with symptomatic COVID-19 compared to nonpregnant counterparts [10, 11] , and fatality rates in pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been reported to be nearly 14-fold higher than those of similarly aged individuals [12] . These reports are consistent with observations of other respiratory viral illnesses, such as pandemic H1N1v influenza, for which associated deaths were > 5-fold higher among pregnant women than among nonpregnant individuals [13] . Additionally, available data to date suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 are potentially also at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth [12, 14, 15] . With the development of COVID-19 vaccines, there is the potential to alleviate the higher risk related to COVID-19 during pregnancy. The first vaccine authorized for emergency use in the United States and conditional approval in Europe, BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, has demonstrated 95 % efficacy in a pivotal clinical trial and ≥90 % effectiveness in real world use studies in preventing COVID-19 in adults aged 16 and older [16] [17] [18] . Data demonstrate maternal transfer of neutralizing antibodies to neonates (as measured in umbilical cord blood), which could also protect infants [19] . Other COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized for use in the United States, Europe, and other countries. Available data in pregnant women indicate that the vaccines have been well tolerated and that immunity (antibodies) maybe transferred to infants [19] [20] [21] . At the time this manuscript was submitted the safety and effectiveness in pregnancy have not been demonstrated in clinical trials with any of these vaccines; however, a clinical trial of BNT162b2 in pregnant women is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04754594).Before conducting clinical trials in humans, the safety of drugs and vaccines must be evaluated in nonclinical safety studies that are designed to support the specific requirements of the clinical trial design, including age, sex, and reproductive status of the participants, duration of treatment, and treatment indication. General toxicology studies in young adult rats showed BNT162b2 was well tolerated, elicited an immune response and resulted in expected inflammatory changes. The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and WHO guidelines describe expectations for the nonclinical study that is necessary prior to performing a clinical trial of a vaccine in pregnant women [22, 23] . This article reports the design and results of the nonclinical developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) study to support initiation of a clinical trial in pregnant women with BNT162b2.All animal care and experimental procedures were conducted in compliance with guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals [24] [25] [26] and were approved by the ethical committee of Charles River Laboratories France Safety Assessment SAS. The facility where this study was conducted is accredited by Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.BNT162b2 is an LNP-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full length spike protein. The lipid components include an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a polyethylene glycol conjugated lipid, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC). BNT162b2 was manufactured and supplied by Polymun Scientific, Klosterneuburg, Austria. The saline control consisted of 0.9 % sterile saline for injection, USP (Lavoisier, France).The study was conducted by Charles River Laboratories France Safety Assessment SAS. An overview of the study design is presented in Fig. 1 . Virgin female Wistar Han rats CRL:WI(Han) (Charles River Laboratories France; approximately 11 weeks old and 179-265 g at initiation of dosing) were acclimated, randomly assigned to groups in two main cohorts (n = 22 per dose group in the Caesarean cohort and n = 22 per dose group in the delivery cohort). Female rats were administered saline or BNT162b2 (30 μg mRNA/dose) intramuscularly (IM; 0.06 mL/ dose) 21 and 14 days prior to the start of mating and on gestation days (GD) 9 and 20, for a total of 4 doses. The 30 μg mRNA/dose is the full human dose but represents greater than 300 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis (based on 220 g rat and 70 kg human).Wistar Han rats CRL:WI(Han) were group housed (up to 5 per cage) until paired for mating at which time females were housed 1:1 with a non-treated breeder male. Following evidence of mating, the females were individually housed through gestation and lactation. Rats were provided with Complete Rodent Diet (Safe, France) available ad libitum. Locally sourced water (softened and filtered) was available ad libitum. Environmental conditions across studies were set to maintain relative humidity ≥35 % and temperature of 66 • F to 77 • F with room lighting set to provide a 12-h light/dark cycle.Clinical signs, body weight, and food consumption were monitored throughout the study. Vaginal smears were collected daily and used to determine the cycle stage from 14 days prior to administration of the initial dose and continued until positive evidence of mating was observed (sperm present in a smear of vaginal contents or presence of copulatory plug). The day on which evidence of mating was observed was designated as GD 0.Rats in the Caesarean cohort were euthanized on GD 21 via CO 2 asphyxiation followed by exsanguination. A gross examination of the abdominal, thoracic, and pelvic viscera was performed. The gravid uterus was removed and weighed, and the number of corpora lutea in each ovary, and the number, type, and position of implantation sites were recorded. Uteri of apparently non-pregnant animals were stained with 10 % aqueous (v/v) ammonium sulfide to confirm absence of implantation sites. Viable fetuses were removed from the uteri and individually weighed. Live fetuses were euthanized by oral administration of sodium pentobarbital (0.05 mL of 182.2 mg/mL; Vetoquinol, France) or by decapitation (for purposes of blood collection). A detailed external examination of each fetus was conducted, including assessment of palatal closure and determination of sex. External, visceral, and skeletal findings were recorded as developmental abnormalities, variations or malformations. Approximately half of the fetuses were examined for visceral abnormalities using a modification of the Staples technique [27] . The heads from approximately half of the rats from each litter were removed and fixed in Harrison's solution and subsequently examined by serial sectioning [28] . The remaining fetuses were eviscerated, macerated in potassium hydroxide, and stained with alizarin red [29] for Overview of the study design. Female rats were administered four intramuscular injections (2 prior to cohabitation with the males and 2 during gestation) of saline (control) or BNT162b2 (44/group). On each dosing day, animals were administered the full human dose (30 μg mRNA/dose) by intramuscular injection into the quadriceps muscle. Approximately half the rats (n = 22/group) underwent cesarean section on gestation day (GD) 21. The remaining rats (n = 22/ group) were allowed to deliver naturally, and the maternal animals and offspring were followed through to the end of weaning. Blood was collected for measurement of antibody response in maternal animals prior to the first dose, at mating, end of gestation, and end of lactation. Blood was collected from fetuses at the end of gestation and from the littered offspring at the end of lactation. skeletal examinations. All fetal morphological observations were recorded in general accordance with standardized terminology [30] . As defined by the Test Facility, fetal observations were classified as either malformations (structural defects that are rare in the control population and are thought to be life threatening or of major physiological consequence), anomalies (minor abnormalities or defects that are relatively rare in the control population and/or are considered not to be of major physiological consequence), or variations (minor abnormalities, defects or alternative forms that are either common in the control population or are of no known physiological consequence).In the littering cohorts, dams were evaluated for natural delivery parameters including duration of gestation, litter size, maternal behavior (e.g. nursing, nesting) and pup viability at birth. Litters were reduced to 8 pups per litter when possible on postnatal day (PND) 4 by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (0.1 mL of 182.2 mg/ mL; Vetoquinol, France). Rat pups that were not selected for continued observation underwent necropsy and gross examination of the abdominal, thoracic, and pelvic viscera. Pups were evaluated for external abnormalities, and body weights and age obtainment of physical developmental landmarks (pinna unfolding and eye opening) were monitored. Pinna unfolding and eye opening were evaluated once daily from PND 1 and PND 12, respectively, until both pinna were unfolded and both eyes were open. Neurofunctional development was evaluated by recording auditory and pupillary reflexes on PND 21 in response to a click sound and light source, respectively. Dams were euthanized on LD 21 via CO 2 asphyxiation followed by exsanguination, and the ovaries and uteri were examined, as well as the abdominal and thoracic cavities, for any gross lesions. The number of implantation sites in the uteri were also recorded. Offspring were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation on PND 21. Following euthanasia, blood was collected from at least 1 pup/sex/ litter as described below, and a gross examination of the abdominal, thoracic, and pelvic viscera was performed.Blood was collected from the dams prior to study initiation, before mating on the day of cohabitation, on GD 21 (Cesarean cohort) and on Lactation Day (LD) 21 (littering cohort). Rat fetal blood samples were collected on GD 21 from arbitrarily selected fetuses by decapitation, and blood samples were pooled by litter (minimum of 1 male and 1 female). Additionally, blood samples were collected on PND 21 from at least 2 pups per litter (1 male and 1 female where possible) via intracardiac puncture following euthanasia and were pooled by litter.Samples were collected into tubes without anticoagulant and centrifugated at 1800 g and 4 • C, for 10 min. The resultant serum was removed, and serum samples were frozen at − 80 • C prior to functional antibody analysis. Each serum sample was tested in duplicate for serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies by VisMederi (Siena, Italy). The SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization cytopathic effect (CPE) based assay is a 4-5 day manual 96-well assay. On Day 0, Vero E6 cells (CRL-1586, American Type Culture Collection) were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates. On Day 1, serial dilutions of test sera were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 2019 nCOV ITALY/INMI1 infectious virus to allow any antigen-specific antibodies to bind to the virus. The serum-virus mixture was then transferred onto the Vero cell monolayer and allowed to incubate for 3-4 days to allow for infection by non-neutralized virus to occur. Plates were visualized under an inverted light microscope and a sample microneutralization titer (MNt) was determined. The MNt was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that protects at least 50 % of the cells from CPE.Continuous data (e.g. body weights, body weight changes, food consumption, and litter averages for percent nonviable conceptuses) were analyzed using Levene's test to assess the homogeneity of group variances. The groups were compared using a Dunnett's test if Levene's test was not significant or Dunn's test if it was significant. Pre-coital interval, estrous cycle and F1 offspring functional test data were analyzed using Levene's test to test the equality of variance across groups and Shapiro-Wilk's test was used to assess the normality of the data distribution in each group. Data with homogeneous variances and normal distribution in all groups were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. Data showing non-homogeneous variances or a nonnormal distribution in at least 1 group were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Litter percent of fetuses with abnormalities was evaluated as nonparametric data using Dunn's test. Incidence data (reflex and physical development, mating performance, fertility indices, and parental indices) were assed using a Fisher's exact test to conduct pairwise group comparisons of interest.Administration of BNT162b2 elicited SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses in all dams and all offspring (Fig. 2) . Neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV2 measured as MNt were detected in all dams at approximately 14 days following the second dose administration just prior to cohabitation, and titers remained elevated on GD 21 and LD 21. Similar to the dams, SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibody titers were observed in all offspring (fetuses on GD 21 and pups on PND 21).There were no BNT162b2-related effects on female fertility, as evidenced by lack of effects on estrous cyclicity, pre-coital interval, and mating, fertility or pregnancy indices (Table 1 ). In the BNT162b2 group, all of these mating performance and fertility endpoints were comparable to concurrent control.All F0 females in both the cesarean section and littering subgroups survived to scheduled euthanasia on GD 21 and LD 21, respectively. The only clinical sign associated with BNT162b2 administration was transient swelling at the injection site following administration of each dose during the premating and gestation periods. The swelling was associated with limping and/or piloerection in some animals for 1 or 2 days after the second dose only. These clinical signs were not considered adverse because the overall health of the animals was not impacted by these transient clinical signs. At maternal necropsy on both GD 21 and LD 21, macroscopic findings localized to the injection site (firm area, enlarged, edematous area and/or pale) were noted, which are consistent with administration of a vaccine and an inflammatory/ immune response.The only other maternal effects that were related to BNT162b2 administration were the slight, transient decreases in body weight (Fig. 3 ) and food consumption (data not shown) that followed each dose administration. The slight body weight loss or reduced body weight gain noted after each dose administration corresponded with the reduced mean food consumption that was noted after the first 3 dose administrations. Complete recovery of the body weight and food consumption effects was noted between each of the dose administrations such that absolute mean body weight and mean food consumption was comparable with the control group within a week or two following each dose administration.There were no BNT162b2-related effects on any ovarian or uterine parameter evaluated at GD 21 cesarean section ( Table 2 ). The numbers of corpora lutea and implantation sites in the control and BNT162b2 groups were both slightly higher than the normal range of historical control (HC). Early embryonic survival was not affected by BNT162b2 administration. Although the mean percentage pre-implantation loss (difference between number of corpora lutea [CL] and implantation sites divided by CL) was statistically (p < 0.05) higher in the BNT162b2 group (9.77 % compared with 4.09 % in the control group), the value was within the historical control data range (1.4-16.2 %) and likely due to the numerically higher number of CL in the BNT162b2 group (14.7 and 15.5 CL in the control and BNT162b2 groups, respectively). However, as there were no differences in the number of implantation sites (14.1 and 14.0 implantation sites/female in the control and BNT162b2 groups, respectively), live fetuses (13.2 and 13.1 live fetuses/dam in the control and BNT162b2 groups, respectively) or live pups in the delivery cohort (13.0 in both the control and BNT162b2 groups) the higher preimplantation loss was considered to represent normal biological variation. BNT162b2 also had no impact on post-implantation embryo-fetal survival. The mean percentage post-implantation loss and the mean live litter size were comparable in the control and BNT162b2 groups and consistent with the historical control data. There were no effects on mean fetal body weights.At GD 21 cesarean section, fetuses were evaluated for potential effects of BNT162b2 on fetal morphological development. There were no BNT162b2-related effects on fetal external, visceral, or skeletal morphology (Table 3) . Two fetuses in the BNT162b2 group were noted with external observations (1 fetus with gastroschisis and 1 fetus with small mouth and agnathia). The fetus with agnathia and a small mouth had associated skeletal malformations of short and fused mandibles. These external malformations are normal background findings in this strain (are within HC incidence) and only occurred in single fetuses and thus were not considered to be related to BNT162b2. The visceral malformation of right sided aortic arch was seen in 1 fetus in the BNT162b2 and not in control fetuses. This finding has not been observed in the testing facility HC data with Wistar rats; however, it has been reported in the HC from CRL Den Bosch in the same strain and source (2 fetuses in 2 litters, with a maximum incidence of 0.8 % fetuses/litter), and therefore this single finding was not considered related to BNT162b2 administration. All other findings noted at fetal visceral and skeletal examination occurred at an incidence within the normal background incidence noted for this rat strain at the performing laboratory, and therefore were considered incidental (Table 3) . Fig. 2 . Functional antibody response against SARS-CoV2, as measured by microneutralization titer (MNt), over time after administration of saline (control) or BNT162b2 to female rats. See methods section for details on the method. MNt in dams were measured just prior to cohabitation for the mating phase, at the end of gestation on GD21, and at the end of lactation on LD 21. There were no detectable titers in females prior to first dose (data not shown). MNt in offspring were measured on GD 21 (fetuses) and PND 21 (pups). Titer data for each individual animal are shown with their respective means. BNT162b2 had no effects on parturition or gestation length ( Table 4 ). The number of pups delivered per litter, mean number of live pups at birth, and the live birth index in the BNT162b2 group were comparable to control. Survival through PND 21 was also not affected by BNT162b2, as demonstrated by the lack of difference in the viability index (percent of pups surviving from PND 0 to PND 4; pre-cull) and weaning index (percent of pups surviving from PND 4 through PND 21; post-cull) as compared to control. BNT162b2 administration had no effects on offspring growth, physical development or neurofunctional development. There were no clinical signs related to BNT162b2 administration and no effects on pup body weights during the preweaning period. There were no effects on preweaning physical or functional development of the F1 pups (Table 5 ). In the BNT162b2 group, the age at which pinna unfolding and eye opening was attained was comparable to the control group. Similarly, all pups in the control and BNT162b2 groups exhibited auditory and pupillary reflexes when evaluated on PND 21. At scheduled necropsy on PND 21, there were no BNT162b2-related macroscopic observations in the pups (data not shown).Experimental studies in animals are currently the best available tools to predict the potential for developmental toxicity of vaccines in humans [31] and are generally considered prerequisites to support clinical studies in pregnant women [32] or registration in target populations that include women of childbearing potential [33] . The current BNT162b2 DART study was conducted based on the design described in Table 3 Summary of rat fetal examination data from the embryo fetal development study with control (saline) and BNT162b2 (n = 21 rats per group). [23] , and the recently updated ICH S5 (R3) guideline, which now includes vaccines for infectious disease [22] . The purpose of this DART vaccine study was to detect any adverse effects on development regardless of the mechanism (e.g. vaccine product itself and/or immune response to that vaccine) [33, 34] . The endpoints in this rat DART vaccine study design have been used for more than 20 years with other therapeutics in female fertility, embryo-fetal development, and pre-and postnatal developmental toxicity studies, and thus this experience and historical control data provide confidence in the suitability of these animal models and endpoints in detection of effects relevant for human risk [22, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] .No adverse effects of BNT162b2 or its associated immune response, were detected on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the offspring through the end of lactation. Vaccination of female rats with BNT162b2 twice prior to mating and twice more during gestation resulted in a robust, neutralizing maternal antibody response that was noted prior to mating, throughout gestation and lactation, as well as in fetuses at the end of gestation and pups at the end of lactation. There were no effects on female rat fertility and reproduction. The lack of female fertility effects is consistent with the lack of microscopic effects in female reproductive organs in non-pregnant rats administered BNT162b2 in prior general toxicology studies (data not shown). The only observations in adult females in the current DART study were nonadverse clinical signs and macroscopic findings localized to the injection site as well as transient, non-adverse body weight and food consumption effects after each dose administration. These findings were consistent with BNT162b2 studies in non-pregnant rats (data not shown) and are related to the inflammatory response following vaccine administration.Therapeutic success in humans using LNP to deliver RNA has been demonstrated using Onpattro (patisiran) [40] . The recommended dosage of Onpattro for patients weighing 100 kg or more is 30 mg by intravenous infusion compared with 30 μg by intramuscular injection for BNT162b2. Onpattro is not a vaccine but a double-stranded RNA that has its therapeutic effect by interfering with the mRNA of a pharmacological target protein in a specific patient population. Regarding nonclinical safety in pregnancy, there were no adverse pre-and postnatal developmental effects associated with Onpattro except for embryofetal lethality in rabbits at maternally toxic doses, which may be associated with a pharmacodynamic-related decrease in Vitamin A (considered essential for embryo-fetal development). With Onpattro there was no fetal transfer of RNA, PEG-C-DMG (lipid component of the LNP), or DLin-MC3-DMA (a different lipid component of the LNP) in rabbit, but in rat approximately 0.4 % fetal transfer of DLin-MC3-DMA was observed. While Onpattro was not designed for in utero delivery, this fetal exposure is consistent with efforts to evaluate different mRNA-LNP formulations for mRNA expression in the fetus, in the absence of maternal toxicity or fetal loss [41] . In addition, while RNA delivered by Onpattro was not detected in milk of lactating rats, both PEG-C-DMG and DLin-MC3-DMA were present. Overall, for Onpattro no fetal or milk transfer of RNA was observed, and the limited transfer of LNP components observed did not correlate with any observed outcome in the pre-and postnatal developmental studies [42] .LNP formulated mRNA vaccines are administered intramuscularly, twice with a 3-or 4-week inter-dose interval and at a much lower dose (30 μg/ intramuscular injection for BNT162b2) compared to 15000-21,000 μg/ intravenous injection for Onpattro [40] based on 50-70 kg individuals. As compared with intravenous and intraperitoneal administration, relatively low amounts of mRNA-LNPs are expected to reach the maternal blood stream via lymphatic draining when administered intramuscularly [43] . Moreover, the maternal-placental blood circulation and the fetal-placental blood circulation are separate circulatory systems providing an additional barrier to the fetus for mRNA-LNP delivery. Therefore, the potential for meaningful fetal exposure to mRNA-LNP vaccines following maternal intramuscular vaccination is expected to be very low. However, due to the robust maternal SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers it is expected that there would be both placental and lactation transfer of those maternal antibodies to offspring [44, 45] as observed in both rat fetuses and pups (Fig. 3) .These DART data with BNT162b2 represent some of the first published data evaluating functional outcomes following administration of an LNP-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine during gestation. Adverse effects on female fertility and pre/postnatal development with BNT162b2 were not observed. The lack of effect on female fertility and development was also observed in a separate female rat DART study with mRNA-1273, another LNP-mRNA vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 [46] . Both COVID-19 LNP-mRNA vaccines use similar lipid components (an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a polyethylene glycol conjugated lipid, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]) and an mRNA encoding the prefusion spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.As pregnant women were excluded from the initial vaccine clinical trials, these nonclinical BNT162b2 DART study data presented here, coupled with broad clinical experience including nonpregnant women, enabled the initiation of clinical evaluation of BNT162b2 in pregnant women. Historically, clinical trials have not often been conducted in pregnant women, and thus critical data to inform benefit/risk in human pregnancy have been lacking. However, several vaccines are recommended for administration to pregnant women, including vaccines protecting against influenza and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. The absence of specific clinical trial data of BNT162b2 in pregnant women resulted in limited uptake of BNT162b2 vaccination in pregnant women, and this vaccine hesitancy is putting mothers and fetuses at higher risk of pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 [47] . Disease risk with respiratory viruses is particularly high in pregnant women, where the resultant reduction in lung capacity can be compounded by pregnancy-induced changes in the maternal immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to complications from infection [9] . Experience from the 2009 influenza pandemic demonstrated the increased benefit-risk ratio of vaccines to infectious disease during pregnancy. Pregnant women with influenza were shown to be at increased risk of influenza-associated complications, including morbidity and death, and their newborn infants were shown to be at increased risk of adverse outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight [48, 49] . There have been many studies demonstrating the safety and immunogenicity of influenza vaccination for pregnant women, including evidence of maternal antibody transfer, confirming the clinical benefit of maternal influenza vaccination both for the mother and the infant, over any perceived vaccination risks [50, 51] .Similar to influenza, COVID-19 in pregnant women carries a higher risk of severe illness compared with infection in nonpregnant women, and increased severity of this illness has been associated with adverse outcomes including preterm birth [2] [3] [4] [5] [10] [11] [12] 14, 15, 52, 53] . The limited data available suggest that SARS-CoV-2 rarely crosses from mother to fetus, although some data indicate that the virus may adversely affect the placenta with potential consequences to the fetus [53, 54] . Natural COVID-19 infection appears to elicit limited transfer of SARS-CoV-2 induced antibodies to the fetus [55, 56] , whereas COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibodies have more consistently been detected in cord blood [19, 20, 57] . This transplacental transfer may offer protection to infants from COVID-19 shortly after birth. There are also data suggesting that, although virus is rarely detectable in breast milk, SARS-CoV-2 induced antibodies are present [55, 56] . In addition, although RNA from COVID-19 vaccines has not been found in breastmilk [58] , available data show that SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are present in breast milk following COVID-19 vaccination, including BNT162b2, during lactation [19, 59, 60] . This is consistent with presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in rat pups from the current DART study following maternal vaccination, and the lack of toxicity in these rat pups may support safety of vaccine-induced antibodies during lactation.Because pregnant women are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and associated complications, it is important to provide more definitive data on the benefit-risk of maternal COVID-19 vaccination in order to aid informed decision-making based on individual vaccine recipient considerations [61] . Currently, there is a positive profile of efficacy and safety in nonpregnant women [17, 62] , and the DART study presented here demonstrates safety of BNT162b2 based on apical endpoints in a guideline-designed toxicity study in animals. This DART study evaluated the clinical dose of 30 μg mRNA/dose, which represents greater than 300 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis. The lack of findings with BNT162b2 in animals supports the safety of using this vaccine in women of childbearing potential and supports the clinical trial in pregnant women (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04754594) that is ongoing at the time this manuscript was written. This prospective study with BNT162b2 in pregnant women coupled with existing and available data being collected to monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant women [21] (including the FDA and CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS] and the CDC's smartphone-based pregnancy registry [V-safe]) will help improve the benefit-risk decision-making for BNT162b2 vaccination in pregnant women.The vaccine BNT162b2 was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To support use in women of childbearing potential, a developmental and reproductive toxicity study was conducted in rats according to regulatory guidelines. Intramuscular administration of the full human BNT162b2 dose of 30 μg mRNA (>300 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis) to female rats twice prior to mating and twice during gestation caused no effects on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the offspring through the end of lactation. A robust neutralizing immune response was confirmed prior to mating and at the end of gestation and lactation. Neutralizing antibodies were also confirmed in fetuses and offspring. No effects of BNT162b2 were observed on female mating performance, fertility, or any ovarian or uterine parameters. The only findings were nonadverse maternal effects related to the local injection site reaction that were expected from other animal studies and consistent with those observed in humans. In concert with the safety profile in nonpregnant people from ongoing vaccination programs, this nonclinical study enabled initiation of a clinical study in pregnant women.CJB, NRC, GDC, SNC, MWC, CMR, RS are currently employed by and hold stock in Pfizer, Inc.

A limited number of studies have suggested that risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness, such as older age and underlying medical conditions, might be similar between pregnant and non-pregnant people; however, individual studies have been limited in sample size, varied in sampling frame and inclusion criteria (e.g., inclusion of women with suspected COVID-19 and/or those with confirmed COVID- 19) , and primarily reported on pregnant women requiring hospitalization (including for childbirth) [2] [3] [4] . Additional information on risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness are needed to inform discussions about risk for severe illness, to guide public health messaging and to inform decision-making around resource allocation.Public health jurisdictions report information, including pregnancy status, on confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System [5] . Through the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET), health departments from 22 jurisdictions collected supplementary information on pregnancy outcomes among women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by nucleic acid amplification testing and reported during March 29, 2020-March 5, 2021 [6] . To determine risk factors associated with COVID-19 illness severity, demographic and selected clinical characteristics were compared between pregnant women with moderate-to-severe or critical illness and those with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.understand the effects of emerging and reemerging threats [6] . Supplementary pregnancy-related information is reported for women with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a clinical specimen by nucleic acid amplification testing) during pregnancy through the day of delivery in 2020 [7] . As of March 5, 2021 Washington) have contributed data [6] . Pregnancy status was ascertained through routine COVID-19 case surveillance or through matching of reported cases with other sources (e.g., vital records, administrative data) to identify unreported pregnancy status or verify pregnancy status.Data were abstracted using standard data elements; sources include routine public health investigations, vital records, laboratory reports, and medical records. SET-NET methodology has been previously described [6] . Data submitted to SET-NET are reviewed for data quality errors (e.g., out of range dates), and feedback is shared with jurisdictions on cases that do not meet inclusion criteria and on cases with potential data issues for selected variables (e.g., date of first positive PCR test).Criteria for illness severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate-to-severe, or critical) were adapted from National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization severity of illness categories ( Figure) [8] [9] . Women were considered asymptomatic if reported as having an absence of symptoms using a symptom status variable. Criteria were applied to classify severity using submitted data (including symptoms, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ventilation, use of COVID-19 therapies, complications associated with COVID-19, and death). If data were not reported for an outcome, the outcome was assumed not to have occurred. Crude risk ratios (RR) for moderate-to-severe or critical illness were calculated for selected demographic characteristics within age group, race/ethnicity, health insurance type, healthcare worker status and selected clinical characteristics, including diagnosis of underlying medical condition (prepregnancy obesity [body mass index ≥30 kg/m 2 ], chronic lung disease, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression), trimester of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and diagnosis of pregnancy-related condition (gestational diabetes and A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7 gestational hypertension) as reported through contact tracing, vital statistics, or medical records, compared to selected referent groups [6] . Calculations for gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension were restricted to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 20 weeks of gestation or later, as these pregnancy-related conditions are typically not diagnosed until later trimesters of pregnancy. We also calculated crude risk ratios comparing risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness among pregnant women with any one condition (underlying medical or pregnancy-related condition), any two conditions, and three or more conditions compared to those without report of any condition. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% CIs for moderate-to-severe or critical illness were estimated by binomial regression with the log link function, accounting for age (in years) as a continuous variable. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute).This activity was reviewed by CDC, determined to be a non-research, public health surveillance activity, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy [10] . Most women were aged 20-39 years (91.2%), 42.0% were Hispanic or Latina (Hispanic) ethnicity, and 54.5% had Medicaid (Table 1 ). At least one underlying medical condition was reported for 2,545 (36.4%) women, with pre-pregnancy obesity (28.2%) most commonly reported. Gestational diabetes was reported in 10.6% of women and gestational hypertension in 10.8%. Most women had SARS-CoV-2 infection identified in the third (57.9%) or second (29.0%) trimester (based on date of first positive test or symptom onset).In crude analyses, pregnant women who were 25-29 years (RR=1.32, 95% CI: 1 Presence of any health condition (underlying medical or pregnancy-related health condition) was associated with 39% increased risk (RR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.53), two conditions was associated with a 59% increased risk (RR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.37, 1.84), and three or more conditions was associated with more than twice the risk (RR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.84, 2.90) of moderate-to-severe or critical illness compared to women without any reported conditions. Race/ethnicity, trimester of SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, gestational diabetes, and gestational hypertension were not associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness compared to the referent groups.Adjusted risk ratios were similar to crude risk ratios with one exception. After adjustment for age as a continuous variable, other health insurance was not found to be associated with a decreased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness compared to the referent group (Private health insurance).In an analysis of a large cohort of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported from health departments from 22 jurisdictions through SET-NET, age 25 years and older, being a A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 healthcare worker, and presence of any underlying medical condition were associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness. The number of underlying medical or pregnancy-related conditions demonstrated an exposure-response relation with risk for moderate-to-severe or critical illness. Data collection is ongoing, and findings may change as additional data are collected and analyzed. Data are reported by health departments and can be updated as new information becomes available. Enhanced efforts to improve reporting of clinical data related to illness severity are ongoing.These findings of association between older age, healthcare occupation, any underlying medical condition and increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness are similar to those observed among nonpregnant adults. There have been few studies focused on risk factors for COVID-19 illness severity in pregnant women; those study findings suggest similar associations with older age and medical comorbidities as seen in the general adult population [2] [3] [4] . In this analysis, approximately half of pregnant women with moderate-tosevere or critical illness had no reported underlying medical conditions, which reinforces the importance of preventive measures, including vaccination, for pregnant women. An association was not found with trimester of SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to findings from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy [4] . An association of Hispanic or Latina race/ethnicity with moderate-to-severe or critical illness was not identified; however, Hispanic or Latina women represented half of all women with moderate-to-severe or critical illness in this analysis.In this analysis an association was observed between occupation as a healthcare worker and increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Data from a large cohort study demonstrated that relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers had a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness [11] . By contrast, at least two systematic reviews which included data from China, Italy, and the U.S. found that healthcare workers were at decreased risk of more severe illness [12] [13] . Infection control training, PPE use, and handwashing were associated with A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 decreased risk. Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk. Considerations for assessing healthcare worker risk of severe disease include overall younger age of healthcare workers, lower prevalence of comorbidities, and potentially increased accessibility to healthcare systems and better knowledge of disease processes. Women of reproductive age make up a large portion of the healthcare workforce, especially in nursing and healthcare support roles, which have frequent, close contact with patients and work in settings that might increase their risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2. A recent report noted that among healthcare workers with COVID-19, 79% of cases were in women. Health care support workers accounted for the largest overall group of occupation types (32%), and nurses constituted the largest single occupation type (30%) [14] .The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, this analysis was limited to pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing and does not include women diagnosed with non-PCR-based tests, such as antigen testing performed in an outpatient setting, and may lead to an under-ascertainment of milder cases. Second, the clinical criteria for classifying illness severity in this analysis were adapted for surveillance purposes from existing frameworks and used severity indicators that were captured systematically, while other criteria may not have been captured (e.g., respiratory rate and oxygen saturation on room air). Misclassification of illness severity is possible, particularly when data to classify cases into moderate-to-severe or critical illness categories are missing, which might bias towards a lower severity classification and attenuate associations [15] . Similarly, data cannot distinguish between asymptomatic, subclinical, or pre-symptomatic mild infection unless the individual subsequently reported for medical care and information was available in a medical record. Additionally, women who were tested upon hospital admission for delivery may have developed more severe symptoms later on that were not captured by SET-NET. Among women with date of testing and outcome available, 21% were identified within two days of delivery, A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 which could reflect universal screening on admission. Third, a large portion of women could not be categorized for illness severity due to insufficient information, and testing and reporting might be more frequent among women with more severe illness. Differences in case ascertainment (e.g., asymptomatic infection detected via universal screening vs testing and reporting of more severe cases of illness) challenge interpretation of the overall distribution of illness severity. The ability to detect differences in demographic characteristics between included and excluded women were limited by a large portion of missing demographic information among excluded cases due to the large surge of cases and limited capacity for complete data collection.Additionally, obtaining accurate data to distinguish underlying medical conditions from pregnancy-related medical conditions (e.g., diabetes vs gestational diabetes) depends on medical record abstraction. Potential misclassification of underlying medical conditions and pregnancy- \n",
            "\t0.717\t99e06a62a0540449852f2f0ff519a75ba31121d4\tThe two opening decades of the third millennium brought to humans three serious infections caused by coronaviruses, the last becoming a world pandemic spreading to every corner of the planet. The disease, named COVID-19 and caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, predominantly afflicts the respiratory system, with effects on other tissues and organs, including the placenta. Pregnant women suffer from the same symptoms as non-pregnant women, such as fever, cough, and myalgia, but are more susceptible to the poor outcomes Viruses 2021, 13 of COVID-19 [1, 2] and pregnancy complications leading to stillbirth, premature rupture of membrane, or intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) [3, 4] . The possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy has been considered and remains an issue under discussion [5] [6] [7] [8] , with a number of studies that did not confirm this process [9] [10] [11] .One of the most serious complications of pregnancy in mothers with COVID-19 is intrauterine fetal death. The reasons for this occurrence are not unambiguous, but pathological changes to the placenta, especially blood perfusion reduction in placental tissue [4, 10, 12, 13] and viral infection of the fetus might be considered [5, 14] . IUFD remains an infrequent complication of pregnancy with COVID-19, without an overall dramatic increase in incidence of this event compared with the pre-COVID period [15] . Here, we present a case of IUFD that happened in the 38th gestational week, providing a detailed analysis of possible factors participating in this unwished complication of pregnancy.Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and submitted to standard routine paraffin processing. Histological slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for basic and diagnostic histological evaluation. Staining with naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetate for the detection of chloroacetate esterase (CHAE) activity was performed to evaluate tissue infiltration by granulocytes. A phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH) stain was used to evaluate the presence of fibrin.The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) were cut to 5 um thick slices, which were deparaffinized, rehydrated, treated for antigen retrieval and immunohistochemically stained using antibodies against the following proteins: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68 (prediluted antibodies, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2, Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), Basigin/CD147 (prediluted antibodies, Bio-SB, Santa Barbara, CA, USA), PDL-1 (dilution 1:500, ab205196; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein (dilution 1:50; Sino Biological, Inc., Beijing, China). After 1 h incubation of the primary antibody at room temperature, the immunohistochemical reaction was visualized by immuno-peroxidase technique using the FLEX EnVision Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a DAKO Autostainer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). For double staining, the Histofine kit for immuno-alkaline phosphatase technique was applied (Nichrei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan).For detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus' RNA in histological sections, the RNA Scope ® detection system, with the use of probes for genomic RNA coding of nucleocapsid (846081) and spike (848561) proteins, was used (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc., Newark, CA, USA).To verify the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the placenta sample, nucleic acids were isolated from the FFPE sample of placenta tissue using The ReliaPrep™ FFPE gDNA Miniprep System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) according to the original protocol, omitting the RNase A digestion step to extract potential virus RNA. After that, qPCR analysis was performed, with the nucleic acids' sample as a template. For the preparation of the qPCR reaction, the qb SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex EndoC kit (GENERI BIOTECH, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic) was used, followed by detection on the BioRad CFX Connect Real-Time PCR system (BioRad Laboratories, Dubai, United Arab Emirates). The qPCR reaction was performed in duplicate.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in fresh tissue samples was performed using the following procedure: the RNA extraction was carried out using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Viruses 2021, 13, 2545 3 of 10 Hilden, Germany) according to protocol for tissue samples and with the use of TissueRuptor II (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) for tissue disruption and homogenization. The same SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR assay was used as described in the previous paragraph.A 32-year-old Caucasian woman at the 38th week of gestation was admitted to the gynecology department on 21 February 2021, at 11:49 p.m., stating an absence of fetal movements since 7:00 p.m. and the presence of contractions since 8:00 p.m., and every 5 min at the time of admission. Sonography identified asystole of the heart of the fetus without pulsations in the umbilical cord, and placental grading was II with a normal value of amniotic fluid. Soon after the admission, at 11:55 p.m., she spontaneously delivered a boy of 3315 g/51 cm, Apgar score 0. The placenta separated completely and was expulsed according to Baudelocque-Schultze.The gynecological history of the patient was without notability. This was her third pregnancy; her last menstrual cycle was on 29 May 2020. Ultrasonographies on the 13th, 20th, and 31st gestational week documented appropriate fetal growth and did not uncover developmental defects.She overcame COVID-19 with mild symptoms, without the necessity of hospitalization. Her PCR test from a nasal swab on 31 January 2021 was positive.Laboratory results: Blood WBC 10ˆ9/l: 13.1, S-CRP mg/L: 11.51; Global coagulation tests: P_PT%: 120.6; P_PT R *: 0.93; P_INR *: 0.91; P_aPTT s: 23.0; P_aPTT R *: 0.96 were normal.The placenta had a size of 16 × 16 × 3 cm and weight of 480 g, corresponding to the gestational age. The three-vessel umbilical cord was inserted centrally, was of a reddish color, 48 cm long, with 1-2 right twists/10 cm and mild varicosities, without real nods. The membranes were slightly yellowish-green, with light peeling-off. The maternal surface was complete, with multiple geographic, merging, grayish-white areas with small calcifications, affecting up to 70% of the placental tissue. These lesions were macroscopically visible on the cut section, with higher frequency underneath the fetal surface ( Figure 1 ).

The maternal surface was complete, with multiple geographic, merging, grayish-white areas with small calcifications, affecting up to 70% of the placental tissue. These lesions were macroscopically visible on the cut section, with higher frequency underneath the fetal surface ( Figure  1 ). The umbilical cord contained three vessels embedded in Warthon s jelly, was without inflammatory infiltrate, and the lumina were without thrombosis. The membranes were of normal histological structure and the amniotic epithelium showed reactive vacuolization of cytoplasm. Decidua capsularis was lightly infiltrated by a mixed inflammatory cell population. The histological picture of the placenta corresponded to the terminal stage of gestation (38+ GW).Pathological changes represented the massive diffuse distribution of foci with accumulation of intervillous fibrin, villous clumping, and villous necrosis in central parts of the foci, with small calcifications. The chorionic villi at the periphery of the foci showed interstitial edema and infiltration with scant histiocytes and lymphocytes, neutrophils appeared only in the necrosis in infarctions, the blood vessels were dilated with congestion, and the syncytiotrophoblast showed sporadic nodule formation. These changes were accompanied by massive fibrin deposition, detected by phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin in the intervillous space, with various degrees of lymphohistiocytic infiltration with an admixture of scant neutrophils (Figure 2 ).The umbilical cord contained three vessels embedded in Warthon´s jelly, was without inflammatory infiltrate, and the lumina were without thrombosis.

These changes were accompanied by massive fibrin deposition, detected by phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin in the intervillous space, with various degrees of lymphohistiocytic infiltration with an admixture of scant neutrophils ( Figure 2 ). Immunohistochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike protein showed only foci with strong cytoplasmic expression in syncytiotrophoblast cells. These positive foci were in centers of the affected areas with necrosis and in isolated foci of morphologically unaffected villi (Figures 2 and 3) . The expression of ACE2 was weak, and focal in decidual cells and the syncytiotrophoblast. TMPRSS2 protein expression was weak, barely detectable, in fact, and exactly the same as the expression in control placental tissues. There was diffuse moderate to strong positivity of CD147 protein and strong expression of PDL-1 protein on the syncytiotrophoblast cell membrane (Figure 3) . The fetus was a mature boy, grossly without anatomical defects, 51 cm long and weighing 3150 g. The autopsy was performed 32 h after delivery. All organs and tissues were of appropriate position, shape, and structure.Histological examination of slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed normal histomorphological structure. A mild increase in interstitial infiltration by small lymphocytes was noted in the lungs (Figure 4) .Immunohistochemical examination of the lung tissue uncovered diffuse interstitial infiltration by equal populations of CD20+ B-lymphocytes and CD3+ T-lymphocytes, with a prevalence of CD8+ over CD4+ cells with a 4:1 ratio. The density of both T-and B-lymphocyte infiltrate was more than four-fold higher compared with control lungs of newborns ( Figure 5 ). No remarkable increase in CD68+ macrophages and neutrophils was detected. Scattered individual or small clusters of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-positive pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells and individual blood vessel endothelial cells were detected in the lungs (Figure 4) . Few individual endothelial cells of the pulmonary vessels Histiocyte-macrophages (CD68+) and T-lymphocytes (CD3+; CD4:CD8/1:4) were present in the individual inflammatory cell infiltrates in the villus interstitium, but were numerous in the intervillous fibrin deposits, with prevalence of histiocyte-macrophages together with a few neutrophils. Double staining of SARS-CoV-2 and inflammatory cells did not show increased accumulation of lymphocytes or macrophages in areas with SARS-CoV-2 protein positivity ( Figure 2 ).In-situ hybridization, with the probes for genomic RNA coding nucleocapsid and spike proteins, identified individual or small groups of positive cells in the intervillous space or in the syncytiotrophoblast (Figure 3 ). These positive areas did not align with the immunohistochemical distribution of nucleocapsid and spike proteins. No hybridization signal was observed in cells within placental villi.The qPCR analysis of formalin fixed tissue confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The signal for the virus was detected for both analyzed E and RdRp virus genes, The fetus was a mature boy, grossly without anatomical defects, 51 cm long and weighing 3150 g. The autopsy was performed 32 h after delivery. All organs and tissues were of appropriate position, shape, and structure.Histological examination of slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed normal histomorphological structure. A mild increase in interstitial infiltration by small lymphocytes was noted in the lungs (Figure 4 ). were also positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by in situ hybridization with the probe for nucleocapsid protein-coding RNA (Figure 4 ). The potential virus-receptor proteins ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147 were not detected in the lung tissue, except for CD147 expression in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells (data not shown). The lung tissue of the control newborn showed similar TMPRSS2 and CD147 expression pattern; however, ACE2 was positive in vascular endothelial cells. PDL-1 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, with significantly weaker positivity in the fetal lungs (data not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis of other tissues and organs, except for the kidney, did not show the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or spike proteins. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was detected in a few individual epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule; the potential virus-receptor proteins ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147 were diffusely positive in both the proximal and the distal convoluted canaliculi epithelial cells (data not shown).Fresh tissue samples from the lung, nasopharynx, and umbilical cord were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, detected by qRT-PCR for both analyzed E and RdRp virus genes, with mean Ct values of 37.57, 32.54, and 32.17, respectively. Immunohistochemical examination of the lung tissue uncovered diffuse interstitial infiltration by equal populations of CD20+ B-lymphocytes and CD3+ T-lymphocytes, with a prevalence of CD8+ over CD4+ cells with a 4:1 ratio. The density of both T-and Blymphocyte infiltrate was more than four-fold higher compared with control lungs of newborns ( Figure 5 ).

The presented case of fetal demise in a pregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19, but without other noteworthy clinical or obstetric disorders, indicates that fetal death is a possible consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women are at higher risk of maternal and fetal adverse outcome; however, the fetal outcome does not seem to depend on the clinical form of COVID-19 symptoms of the mother [16] . An interplay of several factors may participate in such an unfavorable conclusion of pregnancy. As also stated by others [7, 14, 17, 18] , pathological changes in both the placenta and the fetus may result in fetal demise. Some findings in the presented case open additional questions about the pathogenesis of the affection of the placenta and the fetus.The dominant histopathological finding in the placenta was the massive intervillous deposition of fibrinoid, leading to clumping of neighboring villi up to the formation of large aggregates with central necrosis, corresponding to placental infarction. Histological changes identified in our case were consistent with the morphological criteria for standardized definition of placental infection by SARS-CoV-2, suggested by Roberts et al. [19] . Similar findings of an extensive affection of the placenta have been reported in some patients [6, 14, 19, 20] , but not in others [9, 13] , and there was no correlation with the severity of the clinical course of the COVID-19 disease in the pregnant patient. The fibrinoid deposits may be accompanied by an inflammatory reaction with predominant macrophage infiltration [2, 13] , as was also seen in our case. The intense accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was detected in some cases [20, 21] , indicating that activation of NETosis could be part of the developing pathology [6] . In the majority of reported cases, including the one presented here, no prominent villitis was observed.The infection of tissues by SARS-CoV-2 can be identified by immunohistochemical detection of the virus-related proteins [4, 6, 22] . Multiple works documented diffuse staining of syncytiotrophoblast cells in the placenta from some COVID-19-diagnosed patients Immunohistochemical analysis of other tissues and organs, except for the kidney, did not show the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or spike proteins.

In the majority of reported cases, including the one presented here, no prominent villitis was observed.The infection of tissues by SARS-CoV-2 can be identified by immunohistochemical detection of the virus-related proteins [4, 6, 22] . Multiple works documented diffuse staining of syncytiotrophoblast cells in the placenta from some COVID-19-diagnosed patients [6, 23] , however, in some case series, only a few or no positive cases were detected [6, 13] . Surprisingly, in our case, only isolated groups of syncytiotrophoblast cells showed immunohistochemical positivity for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and/or spike proteins. It is noteworthy that the virus' footprints were detectable over three weeks after the positive PCR test in the patient with a mild form of COVID-19. The time factor may play a role in the extent of placental positivity, since the diffuse positivity of the placenta was detected in specimens examined less than 14 days after the mother s COVID-19 positive PCR test from the nasopharyngeal swab [6, 11, 23] . The viral presence in the placenta in our case was also confirmed by PCR test and in situ hybridization. Although in situ hybridization detected the virus only in scattered individual cells, the use of an anti-sense probe documented the presence of a replicating virus [19] . The in situ hybridization results did not overlap with the immunohistochemical detection of the viral proteins. We may speculate that the elimination of the proteins is delayed after the virus' cessation.In immunocompetent individuals, the SARS-CoV-2 replication with the shedding of infectious viral particles does not exceed two weeks [24] . The placenta represents an embryonic tissue foreign to the host organism, that secures immunotolerance from maternal immunocompetent cells by expressing the immunity check-point PDL-1 protein, leading to the inhibition of helper T-lymphocytes. Ineffectiveness of the PD-1/PDL-1 axis might be involved in persistent viral infection [25] . This could explain the permanent synthesis of the viral proteins that continue to induce the coagulation system [26] , resulting in a large extent of intervillous fibrinoid depositions and placental infarction formation, as was seen in the presented case. Continuous activation of complement parallel to the intervillous inflammation may represent another factor promoting the placental tissue damage [21] .It is generally accepted that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to its receptor, human ACE2 (hACE2), through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is proteolytically activated by human proteases. These SARS-CoV-2 entry-activating proteases include cell surface protease TMPRSS2 and lysosomal proteases cathepsins [27] . Another molecule, basigin2 (CD147), was suggested to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 tropism and has been shown to mediate the virus' entrance into host cells by endocytosis [28, 29] . The detection of low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the placenta was in contrast with the high expression of CD147 on the syncytiotrophoblast, indicating that this protein could serve as the dominant receptor for the virus, participating at the initiation and persistence of placental tissue SARS-CoV-2 infection.The transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2 has been discussed by numerous authors in recent months. Several studies did not confirm any transplacental transfer, even in a large patient series [11, 13, 30] , while others demonstrated placental infection with the virus' transfer to the fetus [6, 14, 18, 23] . There is sufficient evidence, also supported by our case, that transplacental SARS-CoV2 transfer to the fetus may happen, although this Viruses 2021, 13, 2545 9 of 10 complication, fortunately, appears to be rare. Post mortem immunohistochemical detection of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins is limited by the time period between death and autopsy. The autopsy of the fetus, performed 34 h after death, was at the upper limit for reliable immunohistochemical SARS-CoV-2 detection possibility [22] . However, the infection of the fetus was also confirmed by the in situ hybridization and the qRT-PCR. In spite of the SARS-CoV-2 infection of the fetus, no histomorphological signs of pulmonary tissue damage were observed. In the lungs, mild to moderate interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate was the only pathological finding.Findings in the presented case indicate that fetal SARS-CoV-2 virus infection was not the cause of the fetal demise. The persistence of the virus proteins' expression by the trophoblast lead to extensive intervillous fibrinoid deposition, with consecutive placental infarction formation and ischemia that lead to the fetus' demise. This rare complication of pregnancy can appear regardless of the severity of COVID-19's clinical course in the pregnant woman.\n",

A limited number of studies have suggested that risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness, such as older age and underlying medical conditions, might be similar between pregnant and non-pregnant people; however, individual studies have been limited in sample size, varied in sampling frame and inclusion criteria (e.g., inclusion of women with suspected COVID-19 and/or those with confirmed COVID- 19) , and primarily reported on pregnant women requiring hospitalization (including for childbirth) [2] [3] [4] . Additional information on risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness are needed to inform discussions about risk for severe illness, to guide public health messaging and to inform decision-making around resource allocation.Public health jurisdictions report information, including pregnancy status, on confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System [5] . Through the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET), health departments from 22 jurisdictions collected supplementary information on pregnancy outcomes among women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by nucleic acid amplification testing and reported during March 29, 2020-March 5, 2021 [6] . To determine risk factors associated with COVID-19 illness severity, demographic and selected clinical characteristics were compared between pregnant women with moderate-to-severe or critical illness and those with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.understand the effects of emerging and reemerging threats [6] . Supplementary pregnancy-related information is reported for women with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a clinical specimen by nucleic acid amplification testing) during pregnancy through the day of delivery in 2020 [7] . As of March 5, 2021 Washington) have contributed data [6] . Pregnancy status was ascertained through routine COVID-19 case surveillance or through matching of reported cases with other sources (e.g., vital records, administrative data) to identify unreported pregnancy status or verify pregnancy status.Data were abstracted using standard data elements; sources include routine public health investigations, vital records, laboratory reports, and medical records. SET-NET methodology has been previously described [6] . Data submitted to SET-NET are reviewed for data quality errors (e.g., out of range dates), and feedback is shared with jurisdictions on cases that do not meet inclusion criteria and on cases with potential data issues for selected variables (e.g., date of first positive PCR test).Criteria for illness severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate-to-severe, or critical) were adapted from National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization severity of illness categories ( Figure) [8] [9] . Women were considered asymptomatic if reported as having an absence of symptoms using a symptom status variable. Criteria were applied to classify severity using submitted data (including symptoms, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ventilation, use of COVID-19 therapies, complications associated with COVID-19, and death). If data were not reported for an outcome, the outcome was assumed not to have occurred. Crude risk ratios (RR) for moderate-to-severe or critical illness were calculated for selected demographic characteristics within age group, race/ethnicity, health insurance type, healthcare worker status and selected clinical characteristics, including diagnosis of underlying medical condition (prepregnancy obesity [body mass index ≥30 kg/m 2 ], chronic lung disease, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression), trimester of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and diagnosis of pregnancy-related condition (gestational diabetes and A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7 gestational hypertension) as reported through contact tracing, vital statistics, or medical records, compared to selected referent groups [6] . Calculations for gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension were restricted to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 20 weeks of gestation or later, as these pregnancy-related conditions are typically not diagnosed until later trimesters of pregnancy. We also calculated crude risk ratios comparing risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness among pregnant women with any one condition (underlying medical or pregnancy-related condition), any two conditions, and three or more conditions compared to those without report of any condition. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% CIs for moderate-to-severe or critical illness were estimated by binomial regression with the log link function, accounting for age (in years) as a continuous variable. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute).This activity was reviewed by CDC, determined to be a non-research, public health surveillance activity, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy [10] . Most women were aged 20-39 years (91.2%), 42.0% were Hispanic or Latina (Hispanic) ethnicity, and 54.5% had Medicaid (Table 1 ). At least one underlying medical condition was reported for 2,545 (36.4%) women, with pre-pregnancy obesity (28.2%) most commonly reported. Gestational diabetes was reported in 10.6% of women and gestational hypertension in 10.8%. Most women had SARS-CoV-2 infection identified in the third (57.9%) or second (29.0%) trimester (based on date of first positive test or symptom onset).In crude analyses, pregnant women who were 25-29 years (RR=1.32, 95% CI: 1 Presence of any health condition (underlying medical or pregnancy-related health condition) was associated with 39% increased risk (RR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.53), two conditions was associated with a 59% increased risk (RR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.37, 1.84), and three or more conditions was associated with more than twice the risk (RR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.84, 2.90) of moderate-to-severe or critical illness compared to women without any reported conditions. Race/ethnicity, trimester of SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, gestational diabetes, and gestational hypertension were not associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness compared to the referent groups.Adjusted risk ratios were similar to crude risk ratios with one exception. After adjustment for age as a continuous variable, other health insurance was not found to be associated with a decreased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness compared to the referent group (Private health insurance).In an analysis of a large cohort of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported from health departments from 22 jurisdictions through SET-NET, age 25 years and older, being a A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 healthcare worker, and presence of any underlying medical condition were associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness. The number of underlying medical or pregnancy-related conditions demonstrated an exposure-response relation with risk for moderate-to-severe or critical illness. Data collection is ongoing, and findings may change as additional data are collected and analyzed. Data are reported by health departments and can be updated as new information becomes available. Enhanced efforts to improve reporting of clinical data related to illness severity are ongoing.These findings of association between older age, healthcare occupation, any underlying medical condition and increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness are similar to those observed among nonpregnant adults. There have been few studies focused on risk factors for COVID-19 illness severity in pregnant women; those study findings suggest similar associations with older age and medical comorbidities as seen in the general adult population [2] [3] [4] . In this analysis, approximately half of pregnant women with moderate-tosevere or critical illness had no reported underlying medical conditions, which reinforces the importance of preventive measures, including vaccination, for pregnant women. An association was not found with trimester of SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to findings from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy [4] . An association of Hispanic or Latina race/ethnicity with moderate-to-severe or critical illness was not identified; however, Hispanic or Latina women represented half of all women with moderate-to-severe or critical illness in this analysis.In this analysis an association was observed between occupation as a healthcare worker and increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Data from a large cohort study demonstrated that relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers had a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness [11] . By contrast, at least two systematic reviews which included data from China, Italy, and the U.S. found that healthcare workers were at decreased risk of more severe illness [12] [13] . Infection control training, PPE use, and handwashing were associated with A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 decreased risk. Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk. Considerations for assessing healthcare worker risk of severe disease include overall younger age of healthcare workers, lower prevalence of comorbidities, and potentially increased accessibility to healthcare systems and better knowledge of disease processes. Women of reproductive age make up a large portion of the healthcare workforce, especially in nursing and healthcare support roles, which have frequent, close contact with patients and work in settings that might increase their risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2. A recent report noted that among healthcare workers with COVID-19, 79% of cases were in women. Health care support workers accounted for the largest overall group of occupation types (32%), and nurses constituted the largest single occupation type (30%) [14] .The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, this analysis was limited to pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing and does not include women diagnosed with non-PCR-based tests, such as antigen testing performed in an outpatient setting, and may lead to an under-ascertainment of milder cases. Second, the clinical criteria for classifying illness severity in this analysis were adapted for surveillance purposes from existing frameworks and used severity indicators that were captured systematically, while other criteria may not have been captured (e.g., respiratory rate and oxygen saturation on room air). Misclassification of illness severity is possible, particularly when data to classify cases into moderate-to-severe or critical illness categories are missing, which might bias towards a lower severity classification and attenuate associations [15] . Similarly, data cannot distinguish between asymptomatic, subclinical, or pre-symptomatic mild infection unless the individual subsequently reported for medical care and information was available in a medical record. Additionally, women who were tested upon hospital admission for delivery may have developed more severe symptoms later on that were not captured by SET-NET. Among women with date of testing and outcome available, 21% were identified within two days of delivery, A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 which could reflect universal screening on admission. Third, a large portion of women could not be categorized for illness severity due to insufficient information, and testing and reporting might be more frequent among women with more severe illness. Differences in case ascertainment (e.g., asymptomatic infection detected via universal screening vs testing and reporting of more severe cases of illness) challenge interpretation of the overall distribution of illness severity. The ability to detect differences in demographic characteristics between included and excluded women were limited by a large portion of missing demographic information among excluded cases due to the large surge of cases and limited capacity for complete data collection.Additionally, obtaining accurate data to distinguish underlying medical conditions from pregnancy-related medical conditions (e.g., diabetes vs gestational diabetes) depends on medical record abstraction.

Older adults, persons with certain coexisting conditions, and front-line workers are at highest risk for COVID-19 and its complications, and, as such, the Centers for Disease Control recommended prioritizing these populations for vaccination. Recent data have shown that other populations, including pregnant women, may also be at increased risk [2, 3] ; however, pregnant women were excluded from initial clinical trials [4, 5] until sufficient safety data in nonpregnant adults had been demonstrated.Because of changes in adaptive immunity and physiology associated with pregnancy, there is a theoretical basis to suggest that pregnant women may be at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] [9] .While not yet conclusive, studies have shown that pregnancy is associated with a greater risk of severe disease among women presenting with symptomatic COVID-19 compared to nonpregnant counterparts [10, 11] , and fatality rates in pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been reported to be nearly 14-fold higher than those of similarly aged individuals [12] . These reports are consistent with observations of other respiratory viral illnesses, such as pandemic H1N1v influenza, for which associated deaths were > 5-fold higher among pregnant women than among nonpregnant individuals [13] . Additionally, available data to date suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 are potentially also at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth [12, 14, 15] . With the development of COVID-19 vaccines, there is the potential to alleviate the higher risk related to COVID-19 during pregnancy. The first vaccine authorized for emergency use in the United States and conditional approval in Europe, BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, has demonstrated 95 % efficacy in a pivotal clinical trial and ≥90 % effectiveness in real world use studies in preventing COVID-19 in adults aged 16 and older [16] [17] [18] . Data demonstrate maternal transfer of neutralizing antibodies to neonates (as measured in umbilical cord blood), which could also protect infants [19] . Other COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized for use in the United States, Europe, and other countries. Available data in pregnant women indicate that the vaccines have been well tolerated and that immunity (antibodies) maybe transferred to infants [19] [20] [21] . At the time this manuscript was submitted the safety and effectiveness in pregnancy have not been demonstrated in clinical trials with any of these vaccines; however, a clinical trial of BNT162b2 in pregnant women is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04754594).Before conducting clinical trials in humans, the safety of drugs and vaccines must be evaluated in nonclinical safety studies that are designed to support the specific requirements of the clinical trial design, including age, sex, and reproductive status of the participants, duration of treatment, and treatment indication. General toxicology studies in young adult rats showed BNT162b2 was well tolerated, elicited an immune response and resulted in expected inflammatory changes. The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and WHO guidelines describe expectations for the nonclinical study that is necessary prior to performing a clinical trial of a vaccine in pregnant women [22, 23] . This article reports the design and results of the nonclinical developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) study to support initiation of a clinical trial in pregnant women with BNT162b2.All animal care and experimental procedures were conducted in compliance with guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals [24] [25] [26] and were approved by the ethical committee of Charles River Laboratories France Safety Assessment SAS. The facility where this study was conducted is accredited by Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.BNT162b2 is an LNP-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full length spike protein. The lipid components include an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a polyethylene glycol conjugated lipid, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC). BNT162b2 was manufactured and supplied by Polymun Scientific, Klosterneuburg, Austria. The saline control consisted of 0.9 % sterile saline for injection, USP (Lavoisier, France).The study was conducted by Charles River Laboratories France Safety Assessment SAS. An overview of the study design is presented in Fig. 1 . Virgin female Wistar Han rats CRL:WI(Han) (Charles River Laboratories France; approximately 11 weeks old and 179-265 g at initiation of dosing) were acclimated, randomly assigned to groups in two main cohorts (n = 22 per dose group in the Caesarean cohort and n = 22 per dose group in the delivery cohort). Female rats were administered saline or BNT162b2 (30 μg mRNA/dose) intramuscularly (IM; 0.06 mL/ dose) 21 and 14 days prior to the start of mating and on gestation days (GD) 9 and 20, for a total of 4 doses. The 30 μg mRNA/dose is the full human dose but represents greater than 300 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis (based on 220 g rat and 70 kg human).Wistar Han rats CRL:WI(Han) were group housed (up to 5 per cage) until paired for mating at which time females were housed 1:1 with a non-treated breeder male. Following evidence of mating, the females were individually housed through gestation and lactation. Rats were provided with Complete Rodent Diet (Safe, France) available ad libitum. Locally sourced water (softened and filtered) was available ad libitum. Environmental conditions across studies were set to maintain relative humidity ≥35 % and temperature of 66 • F to 77 • F with room lighting set to provide a 12-h light/dark cycle.Clinical signs, body weight, and food consumption were monitored throughout the study. Vaginal smears were collected daily and used to determine the cycle stage from 14 days prior to administration of the initial dose and continued until positive evidence of mating was observed (sperm present in a smear of vaginal contents or presence of copulatory plug). The day on which evidence of mating was observed was designated as GD 0.Rats in the Caesarean cohort were euthanized on GD 21 via CO 2 asphyxiation followed by exsanguination. A gross examination of the abdominal, thoracic, and pelvic viscera was performed. The gravid uterus was removed and weighed, and the number of corpora lutea in each ovary, and the number, type, and position of implantation sites were recorded. Uteri of apparently non-pregnant animals were stained with 10 % aqueous (v/v) ammonium sulfide to confirm absence of implantation sites. Viable fetuses were removed from the uteri and individually weighed. Live fetuses were euthanized by oral administration of sodium pentobarbital (0.05 mL of 182.2 mg/mL; Vetoquinol, France) or by decapitation (for purposes of blood collection). A detailed external examination of each fetus was conducted, including assessment of palatal closure and determination of sex. External, visceral, and skeletal findings were recorded as developmental abnormalities, variations or malformations. Approximately half of the fetuses were examined for visceral abnormalities using a modification of the Staples technique [27] . The heads from approximately half of the rats from each litter were removed and fixed in Harrison's solution and subsequently examined by serial sectioning [28] . The remaining fetuses were eviscerated, macerated in potassium hydroxide, and stained with alizarin red [29] for Overview of the study design. Female rats were administered four intramuscular injections (2 prior to cohabitation with the males and 2 during gestation) of saline (control) or BNT162b2 (44/group). On each dosing day, animals were administered the full human dose (30 μg mRNA/dose) by intramuscular injection into the quadriceps muscle. Approximately half the rats (n = 22/group) underwent cesarean section on gestation day (GD) 21. The remaining rats (n = 22/ group) were allowed to deliver naturally, and the maternal animals and offspring were followed through to the end of weaning. Blood was collected for measurement of antibody response in maternal animals prior to the first dose, at mating, end of gestation, and end of lactation. Blood was collected from fetuses at the end of gestation and from the littered offspring at the end of lactation. skeletal examinations. All fetal morphological observations were recorded in general accordance with standardized terminology [30] . As defined by the Test Facility, fetal observations were classified as either malformations (structural defects that are rare in the control population and are thought to be life threatening or of major physiological consequence), anomalies (minor abnormalities or defects that are relatively rare in the control population and/or are considered not to be of major physiological consequence), or variations (minor abnormalities, defects or alternative forms that are either common in the control population or are of no known physiological consequence).In the littering cohorts, dams were evaluated for natural delivery parameters including duration of gestation, litter size, maternal behavior (e.g. nursing, nesting) and pup viability at birth. Litters were reduced to 8 pups per litter when possible on postnatal day (PND) 4 by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (0.1 mL of 182.2 mg/ mL; Vetoquinol, France). Rat pups that were not selected for continued observation underwent necropsy and gross examination of the abdominal, thoracic, and pelvic viscera. Pups were evaluated for external abnormalities, and body weights and age obtainment of physical developmental landmarks (pinna unfolding and eye opening) were monitored. Pinna unfolding and eye opening were evaluated once daily from PND 1 and PND 12, respectively, until both pinna were unfolded and both eyes were open. Neurofunctional development was evaluated by recording auditory and pupillary reflexes on PND 21 in response to a click sound and light source, respectively. Dams were euthanized on LD 21 via CO 2 asphyxiation followed by exsanguination, and the ovaries and uteri were examined, as well as the abdominal and thoracic cavities, for any gross lesions. The number of implantation sites in the uteri were also recorded. Offspring were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation on PND 21. Following euthanasia, blood was collected from at least 1 pup/sex/ litter as described below, and a gross examination of the abdominal, thoracic, and pelvic viscera was performed.Blood was collected from the dams prior to study initiation, before mating on the day of cohabitation, on GD 21 (Cesarean cohort) and on Lactation Day (LD) 21 (littering cohort). Rat fetal blood samples were collected on GD 21 from arbitrarily selected fetuses by decapitation, and blood samples were pooled by litter (minimum of 1 male and 1 female). Additionally, blood samples were collected on PND 21 from at least 2 pups per litter (1 male and 1 female where possible) via intracardiac puncture following euthanasia and were pooled by litter.Samples were collected into tubes without anticoagulant and centrifugated at 1800 g and 4 • C, for 10 min. The resultant serum was removed, and serum samples were frozen at − 80 • C prior to functional antibody analysis. Each serum sample was tested in duplicate for serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies by VisMederi (Siena, Italy). The SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization cytopathic effect (CPE) based assay is a 4-5 day manual 96-well assay. On Day 0, Vero E6 cells (CRL-1586, American Type Culture Collection) were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates. On Day 1, serial dilutions of test sera were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 2019 nCOV ITALY/INMI1 infectious virus to allow any antigen-specific antibodies to bind to the virus. The serum-virus mixture was then transferred onto the Vero cell monolayer and allowed to incubate for 3-4 days to allow for infection by non-neutralized virus to occur. Plates were visualized under an inverted light microscope and a sample microneutralization titer (MNt) was determined. The MNt was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that protects at least 50 % of the cells from CPE.Continuous data (e.g. body weights, body weight changes, food consumption, and litter averages for percent nonviable conceptuses) were analyzed using Levene's test to assess the homogeneity of group variances. The groups were compared using a Dunnett's test if Levene's test was not significant or Dunn's test if it was significant. Pre-coital interval, estrous cycle and F1 offspring functional test data were analyzed using Levene's test to test the equality of variance across groups and Shapiro-Wilk's test was used to assess the normality of the data distribution in each group. Data with homogeneous variances and normal distribution in all groups were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. Data showing non-homogeneous variances or a nonnormal distribution in at least 1 group were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Litter percent of fetuses with abnormalities was evaluated as nonparametric data using Dunn's test. Incidence data (reflex and physical development, mating performance, fertility indices, and parental indices) were assed using a Fisher's exact test to conduct pairwise group comparisons of interest.Administration of BNT162b2 elicited SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses in all dams and all offspring (Fig. 2) . Neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV2 measured as MNt were detected in all dams at approximately 14 days following the second dose administration just prior to cohabitation, and titers remained elevated on GD 21 and LD 21. Similar to the dams, SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibody titers were observed in all offspring (fetuses on GD 21 and pups on PND 21).There were no BNT162b2-related effects on female fertility, as evidenced by lack of effects on estrous cyclicity, pre-coital interval, and mating, fertility or pregnancy indices (Table 1 ). In the BNT162b2 group, all of these mating performance and fertility endpoints were comparable to concurrent control.All F0 females in both the cesarean section and littering subgroups survived to scheduled euthanasia on GD 21 and LD 21, respectively. The only clinical sign associated with BNT162b2 administration was transient swelling at the injection site following administration of each dose during the premating and gestation periods. The swelling was associated with limping and/or piloerection in some animals for 1 or 2 days after the second dose only. These clinical signs were not considered adverse because the overall health of the animals was not impacted by these transient clinical signs. At maternal necropsy on both GD 21 and LD 21, macroscopic findings localized to the injection site (firm area, enlarged, edematous area and/or pale) were noted, which are consistent with administration of a vaccine and an inflammatory/ immune response.The only other maternal effects that were related to BNT162b2 administration were the slight, transient decreases in body weight (Fig. 3 ) and food consumption (data not shown) that followed each dose administration. The slight body weight loss or reduced body weight gain noted after each dose administration corresponded with the reduced mean food consumption that was noted after the first 3 dose administrations. Complete recovery of the body weight and food consumption effects was noted between each of the dose administrations such that absolute mean body weight and mean food consumption was comparable with the control group within a week or two following each dose administration.There were no BNT162b2-related effects on any ovarian or uterine parameter evaluated at GD 21 cesarean section ( Table 2 ). The numbers of corpora lutea and implantation sites in the control and BNT162b2 groups were both slightly higher than the normal range of historical control (HC). Early embryonic survival was not affected by BNT162b2 administration. Although the mean percentage pre-implantation loss (difference between number of corpora lutea [CL] and implantation sites divided by CL) was statistically (p < 0.05) higher in the BNT162b2 group (9.77 % compared with 4.09 % in the control group), the value was within the historical control data range (1.4-16.2 %) and likely due to the numerically higher number of CL in the BNT162b2 group (14.7 and 15.5 CL in the control and BNT162b2 groups, respectively). However, as there were no differences in the number of implantation sites (14.1 and 14.0 implantation sites/female in the control and BNT162b2 groups, respectively), live fetuses (13.2 and 13.1 live fetuses/dam in the control and BNT162b2 groups, respectively) or live pups in the delivery cohort (13.0 in both the control and BNT162b2 groups) the higher preimplantation loss was considered to represent normal biological variation. BNT162b2 also had no impact on post-implantation embryo-fetal survival. The mean percentage post-implantation loss and the mean live litter size were comparable in the control and BNT162b2 groups and consistent with the historical control data. There were no effects on mean fetal body weights.At GD 21 cesarean section, fetuses were evaluated for potential effects of BNT162b2 on fetal morphological development. There were no BNT162b2-related effects on fetal external, visceral, or skeletal morphology (Table 3) . Two fetuses in the BNT162b2 group were noted with external observations (1 fetus with gastroschisis and 1 fetus with small mouth and agnathia). The fetus with agnathia and a small mouth had associated skeletal malformations of short and fused mandibles. These external malformations are normal background findings in this strain (are within HC incidence) and only occurred in single fetuses and thus were not considered to be related to BNT162b2. The visceral malformation of right sided aortic arch was seen in 1 fetus in the BNT162b2 and not in control fetuses. This finding has not been observed in the testing facility HC data with Wistar rats; however, it has been reported in the HC from CRL Den Bosch in the same strain and source (2 fetuses in 2 litters, with a maximum incidence of 0.8 % fetuses/litter), and therefore this single finding was not considered related to BNT162b2 administration. All other findings noted at fetal visceral and skeletal examination occurred at an incidence within the normal background incidence noted for this rat strain at the performing laboratory, and therefore were considered incidental (Table 3) . Fig. 2 . Functional antibody response against SARS-CoV2, as measured by microneutralization titer (MNt), over time after administration of saline (control) or BNT162b2 to female rats. See methods section for details on the method. MNt in dams were measured just prior to cohabitation for the mating phase, at the end of gestation on GD21, and at the end of lactation on LD 21. There were no detectable titers in females prior to first dose (data not shown). MNt in offspring were measured on GD 21 (fetuses) and PND 21 (pups). Titer data for each individual animal are shown with their respective means. BNT162b2 had no effects on parturition or gestation length ( Table 4 ). The number of pups delivered per litter, mean number of live pups at birth, and the live birth index in the BNT162b2 group were comparable to control. Survival through PND 21 was also not affected by BNT162b2, as demonstrated by the lack of difference in the viability index (percent of pups surviving from PND 0 to PND 4; pre-cull) and weaning index (percent of pups surviving from PND 4 through PND 21; post-cull) as compared to control. BNT162b2 administration had no effects on offspring growth, physical development or neurofunctional development. There were no clinical signs related to BNT162b2 administration and no effects on pup body weights during the preweaning period. There were no effects on preweaning physical or functional development of the F1 pups (Table 5 ). In the BNT162b2 group, the age at which pinna unfolding and eye opening was attained was comparable to the control group. Similarly, all pups in the control and BNT162b2 groups exhibited auditory and pupillary reflexes when evaluated on PND 21. At scheduled necropsy on PND 21, there were no BNT162b2-related macroscopic observations in the pups (data not shown).Experimental studies in animals are currently the best available tools to predict the potential for developmental toxicity of vaccines in humans [31] and are generally considered prerequisites to support clinical studies in pregnant women [32] or registration in target populations that include women of childbearing potential [33] . The current BNT162b2 DART study was conducted based on the design described in Table 3 Summary of rat fetal examination data from the embryo fetal development study with control (saline) and BNT162b2 (n = 21 rats per group). [23] , and the recently updated ICH S5 (R3) guideline, which now includes vaccines for infectious disease [22] . The purpose of this DART vaccine study was to detect any adverse effects on development regardless of the mechanism (e.g. vaccine product itself and/or immune response to that vaccine) [33, 34] . The endpoints in this rat DART vaccine study design have been used for more than 20 years with other therapeutics in female fertility, embryo-fetal development, and pre-and postnatal developmental toxicity studies, and thus this experience and historical control data provide confidence in the suitability of these animal models and endpoints in detection of effects relevant for human risk [22, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] .No adverse effects of BNT162b2 or its associated immune response, were detected on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the offspring through the end of lactation. Vaccination of female rats with BNT162b2 twice prior to mating and twice more during gestation resulted in a robust, neutralizing maternal antibody response that was noted prior to mating, throughout gestation and lactation, as well as in fetuses at the end of gestation and pups at the end of lactation. There were no effects on female rat fertility and reproduction. The lack of female fertility effects is consistent with the lack of microscopic effects in female reproductive organs in non-pregnant rats administered BNT162b2 in prior general toxicology studies (data not shown). The only observations in adult females in the current DART study were nonadverse clinical signs and macroscopic findings localized to the injection site as well as transient, non-adverse body weight and food consumption effects after each dose administration. These findings were consistent with BNT162b2 studies in non-pregnant rats (data not shown) and are related to the inflammatory response following vaccine administration.Therapeutic success in humans using LNP to deliver RNA has been demonstrated using Onpattro (patisiran) [40] . The recommended dosage of Onpattro for patients weighing 100 kg or more is 30 mg by intravenous infusion compared with 30 μg by intramuscular injection for BNT162b2. Onpattro is not a vaccine but a double-stranded RNA that has its therapeutic effect by interfering with the mRNA of a pharmacological target protein in a specific patient population. Regarding nonclinical safety in pregnancy, there were no adverse pre-and postnatal developmental effects associated with Onpattro except for embryofetal lethality in rabbits at maternally toxic doses, which may be associated with a pharmacodynamic-related decrease in Vitamin A (considered essential for embryo-fetal development). With Onpattro there was no fetal transfer of RNA, PEG-C-DMG (lipid component of the LNP), or DLin-MC3-DMA (a different lipid component of the LNP) in rabbit, but in rat approximately 0.4 % fetal transfer of DLin-MC3-DMA was observed. While Onpattro was not designed for in utero delivery, this fetal exposure is consistent with efforts to evaluate different mRNA-LNP formulations for mRNA expression in the fetus, in the absence of maternal toxicity or fetal loss [41] . In addition, while RNA delivered by Onpattro was not detected in milk of lactating rats, both PEG-C-DMG and DLin-MC3-DMA were present. Overall, for Onpattro no fetal or milk transfer of RNA was observed, and the limited transfer of LNP components observed did not correlate with any observed outcome in the pre-and postnatal developmental studies [42] .LNP formulated mRNA vaccines are administered intramuscularly, twice with a 3-or 4-week inter-dose interval and at a much lower dose (30 μg/ intramuscular injection for BNT162b2) compared to 15000-21,000 μg/ intravenous injection for Onpattro [40] based on 50-70 kg individuals. As compared with intravenous and intraperitoneal administration, relatively low amounts of mRNA-LNPs are expected to reach the maternal blood stream via lymphatic draining when administered intramuscularly [43] . Moreover, the maternal-placental blood circulation and the fetal-placental blood circulation are separate circulatory systems providing an additional barrier to the fetus for mRNA-LNP delivery. Therefore, the potential for meaningful fetal exposure to mRNA-LNP vaccines following maternal intramuscular vaccination is expected to be very low. However, due to the robust maternal SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers it is expected that there would be both placental and lactation transfer of those maternal antibodies to offspring [44, 45] as observed in both rat fetuses and pups (Fig. 3) .These DART data with BNT162b2 represent some of the first published data evaluating functional outcomes following administration of an LNP-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine during gestation. Adverse effects on female fertility and pre/postnatal development with BNT162b2 were not observed. The lack of effect on female fertility and development was also observed in a separate female rat DART study with mRNA-1273, another LNP-mRNA vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 [46] . Both COVID-19 LNP-mRNA vaccines use similar lipid components (an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a polyethylene glycol conjugated lipid, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]) and an mRNA encoding the prefusion spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.As pregnant women were excluded from the initial vaccine clinical trials, these nonclinical BNT162b2 DART study data presented here, coupled with broad clinical experience including nonpregnant women, enabled the initiation of clinical evaluation of BNT162b2 in pregnant women. Historically, clinical trials have not often been conducted in pregnant women, and thus critical data to inform benefit/risk in human pregnancy have been lacking. However, several vaccines are recommended for administration to pregnant women, including vaccines protecting against influenza and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. The absence of specific clinical trial data of BNT162b2 in pregnant women resulted in limited uptake of BNT162b2 vaccination in pregnant women, and this vaccine hesitancy is putting mothers and fetuses at higher risk of pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 [47] . Disease risk with respiratory viruses is particularly high in pregnant women, where the resultant reduction in lung capacity can be compounded by pregnancy-induced changes in the maternal immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to complications from infection [9] . Experience from the 2009 influenza pandemic demonstrated the increased benefit-risk ratio of vaccines to infectious disease during pregnancy. Pregnant women with influenza were shown to be at increased risk of influenza-associated complications, including morbidity and death, and their newborn infants were shown to be at increased risk of adverse outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight [48, 49] . There have been many studies demonstrating the safety and immunogenicity of influenza vaccination for pregnant women, including evidence of maternal antibody transfer, confirming the clinical benefit of maternal influenza vaccination both for the mother and the infant, over any perceived vaccination risks [50, 51] .Similar to influenza, COVID-19 in pregnant women carries a higher risk of severe illness compared with infection in nonpregnant women, and increased severity of this illness has been associated with adverse outcomes including preterm birth [2] [3] [4] [5] [10] [11] [12] 14, 15, 52, 53] . The limited data available suggest that SARS-CoV-2 rarely crosses from mother to fetus, although some data indicate that the virus may adversely affect the placenta with potential consequences to the fetus [53, 54] . Natural COVID-19 infection appears to elicit limited transfer of SARS-CoV-2 induced antibodies to the fetus [55, 56] , whereas COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibodies have more consistently been detected in cord blood [19, 20, 57] . This transplacental transfer may offer protection to infants from COVID-19 shortly after birth. There are also data suggesting that, although virus is rarely detectable in breast milk, SARS-CoV-2 induced antibodies are present [55, 56] . In addition, although RNA from COVID-19 vaccines has not been found in breastmilk [58] , available data show that SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are present in breast milk following COVID-19 vaccination, including BNT162b2, during lactation [19, 59, 60] . This is consistent with presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in rat pups from the current DART study following maternal vaccination, and the lack of toxicity in these rat pups may support safety of vaccine-induced antibodies during lactation.Because pregnant women are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and associated complications, it is important to provide more definitive data on the benefit-risk of maternal COVID-19 vaccination in order to aid informed decision-making based on individual vaccine recipient considerations [61] . Currently, there is a positive profile of efficacy and safety in nonpregnant women [17, 62] , and the DART study presented here demonstrates safety of BNT162b2 based on apical endpoints in a guideline-designed toxicity study in animals. This DART study evaluated the clinical dose of 30 μg mRNA/dose, which represents greater than 300 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis. The lack of findings with BNT162b2 in animals supports the safety of using this vaccine in women of childbearing potential and supports the clinical trial in pregnant women (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04754594) that is ongoing at the time this manuscript was written. This prospective study with BNT162b2 in pregnant women coupled with existing and available data being collected to monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant women [21] (including the FDA and CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS] and the CDC's smartphone-based pregnancy registry [V-safe]) will help improve the benefit-risk decision-making for BNT162b2 vaccination in pregnant women.The vaccine BNT162b2 was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To support use in women of childbearing potential, a developmental and reproductive toxicity study was conducted in rats according to regulatory guidelines. Intramuscular administration of the full human BNT162b2 dose of 30 μg mRNA (>300 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis) to female rats twice prior to mating and twice during gestation caused no effects on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the offspring through the end of lactation. A robust neutralizing immune response was confirmed prior to mating and at the end of gestation and lactation. Neutralizing antibodies were also confirmed in fetuses and offspring. No effects of BNT162b2 were observed on female mating performance, fertility, or any ovarian or uterine parameters. The only findings were nonadverse maternal effects related to the local injection site reaction that were expected from other animal studies and consistent with those observed in humans. In concert with the safety profile in nonpregnant people from ongoing vaccination programs, this nonclinical study enabled initiation of a clinical study in pregnant women.CJB, NRC, GDC, SNC, MWC, CMR, RS are currently employed by and hold stock in Pfizer, Inc.

            "\t0.717\taf25f32f5916b5dcd17f7197b18c7d154f4a9230\tThe two opening decades of the third millennium brought to humans three serious infections caused by coronaviruses, the last becoming a world pandemic spreading to every corner of the planet. The disease, named COVID-19 and caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, predominantly afflicts the respiratory system, with effects on other tissues and organs, including the placenta. Pregnant women suffer from the same symptoms as non-pregnant women, such as fever, cough, and myalgia, but are more susceptible to the poor outcomes Viruses 2021, 13 of COVID-19 [1, 2] and pregnancy complications leading to stillbirth, premature rupture of membrane, or intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) [3, 4] . The possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy has been considered and remains an issue under discussion [5] [6] [7] [8] , with a number of studies that did not confirm this process [9] [10] [11] .One of the most serious complications of pregnancy in mothers with COVID-19 is intrauterine fetal death. The reasons for this occurrence are not unambiguous, but pathological changes to the placenta, especially blood perfusion reduction in placental tissue [4, 10, 12, 13] and viral infection of the fetus might be considered [5, 14] . IUFD remains an infrequent complication of pregnancy with COVID-19, without an overall dramatic increase in incidence of this event compared with the pre-COVID period [15] . Here, we present a case of IUFD that happened in the 38th gestational week, providing a detailed analysis of possible factors participating in this unwished complication of pregnancy.Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and submitted to standard routine paraffin processing. Histological slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for basic and diagnostic histological evaluation. Staining with naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetate for the detection of chloroacetate esterase (CHAE) activity was performed to evaluate tissue infiltration by granulocytes. A phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH) stain was used to evaluate the presence of fibrin.The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) were cut to 5 um thick slices, which were deparaffinized, rehydrated, treated for antigen retrieval and immunohistochemically stained using antibodies against the following proteins: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68 (prediluted antibodies, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2, Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), Basigin/CD147 (prediluted antibodies, Bio-SB, Santa Barbara, CA, USA), PDL-1 (dilution 1:500, ab205196; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein (dilution 1:50; Sino Biological, Inc., Beijing, China). After 1 h incubation of the primary antibody at room temperature, the immunohistochemical reaction was visualized by immuno-peroxidase technique using the FLEX EnVision Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a DAKO Autostainer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). For double staining, the Histofine kit for immuno-alkaline phosphatase technique was applied (Nichrei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan).For detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus' RNA in histological sections, the RNA Scope ® detection system, with the use of probes for genomic RNA coding of nucleocapsid (846081) and spike (848561) proteins, was used (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc., Newark, CA, USA).To verify the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the placenta sample, nucleic acids were isolated from the FFPE sample of placenta tissue using The ReliaPrep™ FFPE gDNA Miniprep System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) according to the original protocol, omitting the RNase A digestion step to extract potential virus RNA. After that, qPCR analysis was performed, with the nucleic acids' sample as a template. For the preparation of the qPCR reaction, the qb SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex EndoC kit (GENERI BIOTECH, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic) was used, followed by detection on the BioRad CFX Connect Real-Time PCR system (BioRad Laboratories, Dubai, United Arab Emirates). The qPCR reaction was performed in duplicate.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in fresh tissue samples was performed using the following procedure: the RNA extraction was carried out using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Viruses 2021, 13, 2545 3 of 10 Hilden, Germany) according to protocol for tissue samples and with the use of TissueRuptor II (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) for tissue disruption and homogenization. The same SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR assay was used as described in the previous paragraph.A 32-year-old Caucasian woman at the 38th week of gestation was admitted to the gynecology department on 21 February 2021, at 11:49 p.m., stating an absence of fetal movements since 7:00 p.m. and the presence of contractions since 8:00 p.m., and every 5 min at the time of admission. Sonography identified asystole of the heart of the fetus without pulsations in the umbilical cord, and placental grading was II with a normal value of amniotic fluid. Soon after the admission, at 11:55 p.m., she spontaneously delivered a boy of 3315 g/51 cm, Apgar score 0. The placenta separated completely and was expulsed according to Baudelocque-Schultze.The gynecological history of the patient was without notability. This was her third pregnancy; her last menstrual cycle was on 29 May 2020. Ultrasonographies on the 13th, 20th, and 31st gestational week documented appropriate fetal growth and did not uncover developmental defects.She overcame COVID-19 with mild symptoms, without the necessity of hospitalization. Her PCR test from a nasal swab on 31 January 2021 was positive.Laboratory results: Blood WBC 10ˆ9/l: 13.1, S-CRP mg/L: 11.51; Global coagulation tests: P_PT%: 120.6; P_PT R *: 0.93; P_INR *: 0.91; P_aPTT s: 23.0; P_aPTT R *: 0.96 were normal.The placenta had a size of 16 × 16 × 3 cm and weight of 480 g, corresponding to the gestational age. The three-vessel umbilical cord was inserted centrally, was of a reddish color, 48 cm long, with 1-2 right twists/10 cm and mild varicosities, without real nods. The membranes were slightly yellowish-green, with light peeling-off. The maternal surface was complete, with multiple geographic, merging, grayish-white areas with small calcifications, affecting up to 70% of the placental tissue. These lesions were macroscopically visible on the cut section, with higher frequency underneath the fetal surface ( Figure 1 ).

The maternal surface was complete, with multiple geographic, merging, grayish-white areas with small calcifications, affecting up to 70% of the placental tissue. These lesions were macroscopically visible on the cut section, with higher frequency underneath the fetal surface ( Figure  1 ). The umbilical cord contained three vessels embedded in Warthon s jelly, was without inflammatory infiltrate, and the lumina were without thrombosis. The membranes were of normal histological structure and the amniotic epithelium showed reactive vacuolization of cytoplasm. Decidua capsularis was lightly infiltrated by a mixed inflammatory cell population. The histological picture of the placenta corresponded to the terminal stage of gestation (38+ GW).Pathological changes represented the massive diffuse distribution of foci with accumulation of intervillous fibrin, villous clumping, and villous necrosis in central parts of the foci, with small calcifications. The chorionic villi at the periphery of the foci showed interstitial edema and infiltration with scant histiocytes and lymphocytes, neutrophils appeared only in the necrosis in infarctions, the blood vessels were dilated with congestion, and the syncytiotrophoblast showed sporadic nodule formation. These changes were accompanied by massive fibrin deposition, detected by phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin in the intervillous space, with various degrees of lymphohistiocytic infiltration with an admixture of scant neutrophils (Figure 2 ).The umbilical cord contained three vessels embedded in Warthon´s jelly, was without inflammatory infiltrate, and the lumina were without thrombosis.

These changes were accompanied by massive fibrin deposition, detected by phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin in the intervillous space, with various degrees of lymphohistiocytic infiltration with an admixture of scant neutrophils ( Figure 2 ). Immunohistochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike protein showed only foci with strong cytoplasmic expression in syncytiotrophoblast cells. These positive foci were in centers of the affected areas with necrosis and in isolated foci of morphologically unaffected villi (Figures 2 and 3) . The expression of ACE2 was weak, and focal in decidual cells and the syncytiotrophoblast. TMPRSS2 protein expression was weak, barely detectable, in fact, and exactly the same as the expression in control placental tissues. There was diffuse moderate to strong positivity of CD147 protein and strong expression of PDL-1 protein on the syncytiotrophoblast cell membrane (Figure 3) . The fetus was a mature boy, grossly without anatomical defects, 51 cm long and weighing 3150 g. The autopsy was performed 32 h after delivery. All organs and tissues were of appropriate position, shape, and structure.Histological examination of slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed normal histomorphological structure. A mild increase in interstitial infiltration by small lymphocytes was noted in the lungs (Figure 4) .Immunohistochemical examination of the lung tissue uncovered diffuse interstitial infiltration by equal populations of CD20+ B-lymphocytes and CD3+ T-lymphocytes, with a prevalence of CD8+ over CD4+ cells with a 4:1 ratio. The density of both T-and B-lymphocyte infiltrate was more than four-fold higher compared with control lungs of newborns ( Figure 5 ). No remarkable increase in CD68+ macrophages and neutrophils was detected. Scattered individual or small clusters of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-positive pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells and individual blood vessel endothelial cells were detected in the lungs (Figure 4) . Few individual endothelial cells of the pulmonary vessels Histiocyte-macrophages (CD68+) and T-lymphocytes (CD3+; CD4:CD8/1:4) were present in the individual inflammatory cell infiltrates in the villus interstitium, but were numerous in the intervillous fibrin deposits, with prevalence of histiocyte-macrophages together with a few neutrophils. Double staining of SARS-CoV-2 and inflammatory cells did not show increased accumulation of lymphocytes or macrophages in areas with SARS-CoV-2 protein positivity ( Figure 2 ).In-situ hybridization, with the probes for genomic RNA coding nucleocapsid and spike proteins, identified individual or small groups of positive cells in the intervillous space or in the syncytiotrophoblast (Figure 3 ). These positive areas did not align with the immunohistochemical distribution of nucleocapsid and spike proteins. No hybridization signal was observed in cells within placental villi.The qPCR analysis of formalin fixed tissue confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The signal for the virus was detected for both analyzed E and RdRp virus genes, The fetus was a mature boy, grossly without anatomical defects, 51 cm long and weighing 3150 g. The autopsy was performed 32 h after delivery. All organs and tissues were of appropriate position, shape, and structure.Histological examination of slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed normal histomorphological structure. A mild increase in interstitial infiltration by small lymphocytes was noted in the lungs (Figure 4 ). were also positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by in situ hybridization with the probe for nucleocapsid protein-coding RNA (Figure 4 ). The potential virus-receptor proteins ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147 were not detected in the lung tissue, except for CD147 expression in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells (data not shown). The lung tissue of the control newborn showed similar TMPRSS2 and CD147 expression pattern; however, ACE2 was positive in vascular endothelial cells. PDL-1 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, with significantly weaker positivity in the fetal lungs (data not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis of other tissues and organs, except for the kidney, did not show the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or spike proteins. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was detected in a few individual epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule; the potential virus-receptor proteins ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147 were diffusely positive in both the proximal and the distal convoluted canaliculi epithelial cells (data not shown).Fresh tissue samples from the lung, nasopharynx, and umbilical cord were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, detected by qRT-PCR for both analyzed E and RdRp virus genes, with mean Ct values of 37.57, 32.54, and 32.17, respectively. Immunohistochemical examination of the lung tissue uncovered diffuse interstitial infiltration by equal populations of CD20+ B-lymphocytes and CD3+ T-lymphocytes, with a prevalence of CD8+ over CD4+ cells with a 4:1 ratio. The density of both T-and Blymphocyte infiltrate was more than four-fold higher compared with control lungs of newborns ( Figure 5 ).

PDL-1 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, with significantly weaker positivity in the fetal lungs (data not shown). The presented case of fetal demise in a pregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19, but without other noteworthy clinical or obstetric disorders, indicates that fetal death is a possible consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women are at higher risk of maternal and fetal adverse outcome; however, the fetal outcome does not seem to depend on the clinical form of COVID-19 symptoms of the mother [16] . An interplay of several factors may participate in such an unfavorable conclusion of pregnancy. As also stated by others [7, 14, 17, 18] , pathological changes in both the placenta and the fetus may result in fetal demise. Some findings in the presented case open additional questions about the pathogenesis of the affection of the placenta and the fetus.The dominant histopathological finding in the placenta was the massive intervillous deposition of fibrinoid, leading to clumping of neighboring villi up to the formation of large aggregates with central necrosis, corresponding to placental infarction. Histological changes identified in our case were consistent with the morphological criteria for standardized definition of placental infection by SARS-CoV-2, suggested by Roberts et al. [19] . Similar findings of an extensive affection of the placenta have been reported in some patients [6, 14, 19, 20] , but not in others [9, 13] , and there was no correlation with the severity of the clinical course of the COVID-19 disease in the pregnant patient. The fibrinoid deposits may be accompanied by an inflammatory reaction with predominant macrophage infiltration [2, 13] , as was also seen in our case. The intense accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was detected in some cases [20, 21] , indicating that activation of NETosis could be part of the developing pathology [6] . In the majority of reported cases, including the one presented here, no prominent villitis was observed.The infection of tissues by SARS-CoV-2 can be identified by immunohistochemical detection of the virus-related proteins [4, 6, 22] . Multiple works documented diffuse staining of syncytiotrophoblast cells in the placenta from some COVID-19-diagnosed patients Immunohistochemical analysis of other tissues and organs, except for the kidney, did not show the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or spike proteins. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was detected in a few individual epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule; the potential virus-receptor proteins ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147 were diffusely positive in both the proximal and the distal convoluted canaliculi epithelial cells (data not shown).Fresh tissue samples from the lung, nasopharynx, and umbilical cord were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, detected by qRT-PCR for both analyzed E and RdRp virus genes, with mean Ct values of 37.57, 32.54, and 32.17, respectively.The presented case of fetal demise in a pregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19, but without other noteworthy clinical or obstetric disorders, indicates that fetal death is a possible consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy.

In the majority of reported cases, including the one presented here, no prominent villitis was observed.The infection of tissues by SARS-CoV-2 can be identified by immunohistochemical detection of the virus-related proteins [4, 6, 22] . Multiple works documented diffuse staining of syncytiotrophoblast cells in the placenta from some COVID-19-diagnosed patients [6, 23] , however, in some case series, only a few or no positive cases were detected [6, 13] . Surprisingly, in our case, only isolated groups of syncytiotrophoblast cells showed immunohistochemical positivity for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and/or spike proteins. It is noteworthy that the virus' footprints were detectable over three weeks after the positive PCR test in the patient with a mild form of COVID-19. The time factor may play a role in the extent of placental positivity, since the diffuse positivity of the placenta was detected in specimens examined less than 14 days after the mother s COVID-19 positive PCR test from the nasopharyngeal swab [6, 11, 23] . The viral presence in the placenta in our case was also confirmed by PCR test and in situ hybridization. Although in situ hybridization detected the virus only in scattered individual cells, the use of an anti-sense probe documented the presence of a replicating virus [19] . The in situ hybridization results did not overlap with the immunohistochemical detection of the viral proteins. We may speculate that the elimination of the proteins is delayed after the virus' cessation.In immunocompetent individuals, the SARS-CoV-2 replication with the shedding of infectious viral particles does not exceed two weeks [24] . The placenta represents an embryonic tissue foreign to the host organism, that secures immunotolerance from maternal immunocompetent cells by expressing the immunity check-point PDL-1 protein, leading to the inhibition of helper T-lymphocytes. Ineffectiveness of the PD-1/PDL-1 axis might be involved in persistent viral infection [25] . This could explain the permanent synthesis of the viral proteins that continue to induce the coagulation system [26] , resulting in a large extent of intervillous fibrinoid depositions and placental infarction formation, as was seen in the presented case. Continuous activation of complement parallel to the intervillous inflammation may represent another factor promoting the placental tissue damage [21] .It is generally accepted that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to its receptor, human ACE2 (hACE2), through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is proteolytically activated by human proteases. These SARS-CoV-2 entry-activating proteases include cell surface protease TMPRSS2 and lysosomal proteases cathepsins [27] . Another molecule, basigin2 (CD147), was suggested to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 tropism and has been shown to mediate the virus' entrance into host cells by endocytosis [28, 29] . The detection of low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the placenta was in contrast with the high expression of CD147 on the syncytiotrophoblast, indicating that this protein could serve as the dominant receptor for the virus, participating at the initiation and persistence of placental tissue SARS-CoV-2 infection.The transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2 has been discussed by numerous authors in recent months. Several studies did not confirm any transplacental transfer, even in a large patient series [11, 13, 30] , while others demonstrated placental infection with the virus' transfer to the fetus [6, 14, 18, 23] . There is sufficient evidence, also supported by our case, that transplacental SARS-CoV2 transfer to the fetus may happen, although this Viruses 2021, 13, 2545 9 of 10 complication, fortunately, appears to be rare. Post mortem immunohistochemical detection of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins is limited by the time period between death and autopsy. The autopsy of the fetus, performed 34 h after death, was at the upper limit for reliable immunohistochemical SARS-CoV-2 detection possibility [22] . However, the infection of the fetus was also confirmed by the in situ hybridization and the qRT-PCR. In spite of the SARS-CoV-2 infection of the fetus, no histomorphological signs of pulmonary tissue damage were observed. In the lungs, mild to moderate interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate was the only pathological finding.Findings in the presented case indicate that fetal SARS-CoV-2 virus infection was not the cause of the fetal demise. The persistence of the virus proteins' expression by the trophoblast lead to extensive intervillous fibrinoid deposition, with consecutive placental infarction formation and ischemia that lead to the fetus' demise. This rare complication of pregnancy can appear regardless of the severity of COVID-19's clinical course in the pregnant woman.\n"

            "Abstract:  Background and aims In addition to respiratory symptoms, patients with COVID-19 can present with gastrointestinal complaints suggesting a possible faeco-oral transmission route. The primary aim of this review is to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for the virus in their stool. Data were extracted concerning the nature of the test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and any evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus. Results There were 26 relevant articles identified. Combining these results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA in these studies were positive. Duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after nasopharyngeal swab turned negative with one result remaining positive after 47 days of onset of symptoms. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the proportion of cases potentially transmitted through infection via faecally shed virus. Conclusions There is a relatively high rate of positive tests and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in faecal samples of selected patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to demonstrate how much these positive tests correlate with viable virus and transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications for duration of isolation, precautions recommended in individuals undertaking a period of isolation, protective equipment for health professionals and interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.\n",

            "Abstract:  Background Reports suggest that asymptomatic individuals (those with no symptoms at all throughout the infection) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are infectious, but the extent of asymptomatic transmission requires further understanding. Purpose This living review aims to critically appraise available data about secondary attack rates from people with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data sources Medline, EMBASE, China Academic Journals full-text database (CNKI), and pre-print servers were searched from 30 December 2019 to 3 July 2020 using relevant MESH terms. Study selection Studies that report on contact tracing of index cases with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in either English or Chinese were included. Data extraction Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. We calculated the secondary attack rate as the number of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, divided by the number of contacts tested. Data synthesis Of 928 studies identified, 19 were included. Secondary attack rates from asymptomatic index cases ranged from 0% to 2.8% (9 studies). Pre-symptomatic secondary attack rates ranged from 0.7% to 31.8% (10 studies). The highest secondary attack rates were found in contacts who lived in the same household as the index case. Other activities associated with transmission were group activities such as sharing meals or playing board games with the index case. Limitations We excluded some studies because the index case or number of contacts were unclear. Owing to the anticipated heterogeneity, we did not produce a summary estimate of the included studies. Conclusion Asymptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, but our findings indicate that such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with symptoms in the same studies.

            "Abstract:  Background: There is substantial disagreement about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a population. The disagreement results, in part, from the interpretation of studies that report a proportion of asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 detected at a single point. Review questions: 1. Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? 2. Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? 3. What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection, or pre-symptomatic? Methods: Rapid living systematic review (protocol https://osf.io/9ewys/). We searched Pubmed, Embase, bioRxiv and medRxiv using a living evidence database of SARS-CoV-2 literature on 25.03.2020. We included studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up and modelling studies. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment were done by one reviewer and verified by a second, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. We used a common-effect model to synthesise proportions from comparable studies. Results: We screened 89 studies and included 11. We estimated an upper bound for the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections of 29% (95% confidence interval 23 to 37%) in eight studies. Selection bias and likely publication bias affected the family case investigation studies. One statistical modelling study estimated the true proportion of asymptomatic infections at 18% (95% credibility interval 16 to 20%). Estimates of the proportions of pre-symptomatic individual in four studies were too heterogeneous to combine. In modelling studies, 40-60% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are the result of transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals, with a smaller contribution from asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: An intermediate contribution of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention, with enhanced hand and respiratory hygiene, testing tracing and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed. The findings of this systematic review of publications early in the pandemic suggests that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection.\n",

            "Abstract:  Since December 2019, China has experienced a widespread outbreak of COVID-19. However, at the early stage of outbreak, investigations revealed a variety of patterns resulting in the transmission of COVID-19. Thus, it is essential to understand the transmission types and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Moreover, the information regarding the characteristics of transmission helps in coordinating the current screening programme, and controlling and containing measures, and also, helps in deciding the appropriate quarantine duration. Thus, this investigation reports an outbreak of COVID-19 in a family residing in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China during the month of January−February 2020.\n"
